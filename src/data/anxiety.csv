Anxiety,Anxiety so bad I want to kms,"I have had panic attacks on and off for so many years now. They come in like episodes I guess once a year or once every year and a half but when they do they’re so bad. I cannot leave my house. I don’t want to leave my bed. I don’t want to do anything. Overall, I am just an anxious person but right now it is so bad and debilitating. I have to take  weeks off work because I physically cannot do anything without getting I panic attack. I am so tired of living like this. I cannot remember the last time I actually felt safe and peaceful. My life isn’t hard or bad which just makes me feel worse because I’m literally feeling like this for no reason. It’s always trying to get better and feeling like you’re doing okay for a couple months just to get worse again and way worse than before. I’m tired of living like this. I cannot do this anymore. What is the point of trying to live if I can’t enjoy anything? Obviously I’m not actually going to kms because I am terrified of dying but I just want this all to end. I cannot do this anymore. I wish I could just sleep forever. I hate myself. I hate my brain. I think I’m also depressed because I am so anxious. I have no hope for my future."
Anxiety,Autophobia,
Anxiety,Anxiety meds,"Hey guys I’m an f and I want to get started on anxiety medication. 

I’ve had anxiety most of my life, especially in the social sector. It gotten worse since I started puberty and now I’m not even able to go a day without having massive anxiety about friends, school or really just anything.

To the people that will say I should try therapy first: I’ve been going to one for , years. It has helped in some situations bur not enough.

So yeah that’s the reason I wanna start medication. I would have tried to earlier but both my parents are against mental health and medication so there wasn’t really a chance.

Anyways, does anyone have any advice how to ask my therapist for a diagnosis? I’m not sure he’s able to give one so I would have to go to a psychologist."
Anxiety,Tingling only in feet from Anxiety?,"I had a foot issue around  months ago (stabbing heel pain) where I googled the symptoms (no joke) probably more than  times within a few months. I went to  foot doctors, had an mri and ultrasound, and have all said my foot was pretty fine apart from some small joint effusion.

Since then I am nearly always thinking ""I hope I don't get this tingling today"" or if I go for a walk i'll expect this tingling to happen after. Nearly everyday/morning I get these sensations, and randomly throughout the day in my left foot and sometimes on my right (pinky toe, big toe, bottom of heel, backs of both heels buzzing etc) Unless this is some sort of nerve compression/damage (which i doubt it as i can press hard into the tingling and there is no pain), could these be symptoms from me googling/overthinking it nearly / so much that it's just always there from anxiety now? If anyone has a similar story I'd love to hear it..."
Anxiety,feeling extremely guilty; my friend wanted some moral support today because she has a hard time not drinking during NYE/NY. she suddenly changed her mind and doesn't want me to come over anymore saying she's having a shitty day. why do I suddenly feel responsible for whatever she might do tonight?,
Anxiety,Random resurfacing of unprocessed trauma causing insomnia,"Recently I realized that trauma I thought I’d already processed from  years ago might have resurfaced for some reason and in addition to effecting me at work might also be the cause behind my problems sleeping and I don’t know why now of all times it’s doing that because I thought I’d already put it behind me and it’s really frustrating me.

Long story short before my current retail job of six years I was a nanny/babysitter for a family with five kids for  years and for the first six years of that time I was the secondary caregiver to the primary nanny before working solo for the last eight years.

Before she was fired/quit my former coworker verbally abused me and gaslighted me because she was frustrated with her own life and mad that she couldn’t do the job by herself and she saw me as a threat to her and being young and clueless thought she could manipulate me into not even realizing what she was doing but I hit a breaking point and finally wised up as did the parents of the children who were sick of dealing with her but thought it was all in their heads and from that point on I worked solo the rest of my time with them.

I thought it was all behind me for a while now but my anxiety has recently flared up and something happened at work the other day that made me realize that trauma is probably to blame for it and I don’t know if it’s because of my hitting the six year mark at work subconsciously reminded my brain of what happened around the six year mark at my last job or if I never truly processed it entirely like I thought and it is just coming back because of insecurities in my emotional state and I really feel like I should finally pursue counseling to help me with my anxiety as a result.

Case in point it’s my night off from work and I stayed up a few hours late watching a matinee hockey game but I’m normally in bed five hours ago and I’m still wide awake as we speak three hours after going to bed and my brain just won’t shut off and sleep and I know my cold probably is to blame for that partly because I was logy for most of the night/morning but I was struggling even before the cold so it’s not entirely to blame.

I also have my anxiety ridden coworker to thank for helping me realize this and keeping me honest with myself and calling me out for my destructive thoughts and I don’t know what I’d do without the accountability and understanding because it’s helped me tremendously in ways I never knew were possible so for that I’m eternally grateful.

Anyone else deal with something similar and how did you work through it once and for all?"
Anxiety,Never had before but I now am,"Here’s a short rundown of how I’ve felt recently. First, I don’t ever have anxiety like this however I was drinking with some buddies and all the sudden it kicked in hard. Since that night it’s been a  day battle of anxiety (on/off) please if anybody has any answers to why this may be happening it feels like it’s been overruling me."

Anxiety,How to not let anxiety affect my job performance?,
Anxiety,Feeling crazy and uncomfortable…….,"Do you guys ever feel like you just don’t know what to do with yourselves because of the anxiety? I’m uncomfortable at home. I’m uncomfortable if I leave home. I just feel like I’m in constant panic all the time. I have been using distraction alot latey but there is only so much distracting I can do. As soon as I stop, the feelings of anxiety come back. I just want to “be” sometimes like other people and be able to calmly watch a movie or look at a magazine. SOMETHING!!!!!! It’s making me feel like I’m going insane because I can never just be calm.
I feel neurotic trying to distract myself  hours a day!!!!!"
Anxiety,Hyper aware of my shoulder blades,"Ok. So I’m not sure if the is anxiety or what and I’m shit at wording myself so.. yeah. Here goes nothing.

I sometimes get extremely aware of my shoulder blades. I can’t stand when something touches them. Bra strap running down my back? No thanks. Don’t get me a “normal” bra. Just sitting in a car seat? Yeah. When I’m like this I’m leaning forward. I just can’t handle it. I have a co-worker that sometimes holds my hand on my back. Sometimes he’ll come in contact with my shoulder blades and I will act busy to avoid him staying there. I can’t seem to calm myself down, when I’m like this. Sometimes this stays for days.

The feeling is similar to when I start my catastrophic thinking. Increased heart rate, tight chest, and if I just stand in it.. it kind of feels like my skin is curling up on the inside (not sure how else to explain it).

There are no thoughts tough. Just the unbearably uncomfortable feeling. What is this?
Anyone else have anything like this?
There are probably relevant information I’m not even thinking about, so ask anything."

Anxiety,Need help on chest pain from anxiety,"Hi. i have been experiencing hardcore anxiety lately and it results in severe chest pain, like something is clenching right in the middle of my breastbone. It feels like I can’t breathe and like I’m choking almost, here and there I feel a tickle in the back of my throat even. It hasn’t subsided at all in the past few hours. It’s debilitating, I’m shaky and feverish and my mind keeps fixating on the thing that’s bothering me.
Any tips to get it to go away from those who have experienced what I am experiencing? Any personal experiences or tips are much welcomed.
I do not have meds or anxiety prescription drugs and have never been to the doctor for anxiety. So far I’ve taken to watching my friend play video games but the pain is still there. I tried to sleep it off as well. In the past, playing voice chat games have helped me relax but I can’t bring myself to speak right now.
Thank you all and I hope you all are doing well."

Anxiety,Ketamine for anxiety,Does anyone have any experience with this? I have a sister who has tried everything under the Sun for her anxiety. It’s tough to watch your loved ones suffer. I stumbled across a post where someone mentioned it for this ailment. But not much momentum on the post. So asking again to see if anyone has any input.
Anxiety,I feel off,"So I experienced a panic attack over a social interaction. I need advice, I haven’t felt like myself and I know it’s all in my head. I have been experiencing de realization and de personalization. I am just not getting back into the gym and taking vitamins that are mood boosting as well as trying to bring my weight down. Basically I feel dizzy at times and my head hurts. I also feel like I am always at %. I am been through a similar situation that I climbed out of years ago without medication and i don’t wish to be put on any. The doctor pretty much told me there isn’t a way to get better without medication but I refuse to believe that. Anyone got any advice?"
Anxiety,Can you be exclusively subconsciously stressed/anxious?,"Started developing a bunch of health issues that technically could be caused by anxiety (chills, night sweats, gastritis, tmj, bilateral sciatica, muscle weakness, hair shedding, etc) in the span of a single week that have continued to this day. I had  months of extensive testing and specialist visits that basically ruled out everything. I spent so much money on the mris, blood tests, muscle exams, urine tests etc. with orthos and neurologists so I'm not looking for advice on what tests I might have missed. One medical professional told me that he hates asking this question, but if I thought I may have anxiety that may be causing these symptoms. 

After that I thought maybe I did have anxiety after all. Though I feel totally normal and relaxed when symptoms arise, maybe there's a type of anxiety that isn't consciously experienced. Maybe I could be stressed and anxious but not even know it. I'm the calm collected one out of my friends and family so I never really thought of myself as anxious, but all these symptoms...it's pretty much impossible that I'm experiencing them all with no clinical markers. Seeing how bad my immediate family is with anxiety, it makes me wonder if it didn't miss me after all, but I have a weird special kind that I can't perceive? I've never had anything remotely close to a panic attack, for example. 

I'm planning on making an appointment with a therapist to go over this possibility but was hoping anyone in this subreddit had experience here? Is it worth it to try anti anxiety treatment and see if I start to feel better?"
Anxiety,I got promoted to assistant manager after less than months,"I started a cashier job at a truck stop six months ago. I've never been good at math and was anxious about the math aspect of everything bc math has NEVER been my strong suit. I recently got promoted to assistant manager, in a few days I'm going to start my management training. I'm really nervous because I'll be doing some bookkeeping. I don't want upper management to think they made a mistake because I'm good and communicating with my coworkers and making sure everyone stays on track. But does anyone know what goes into bookkeeping? And some payroll?  I'm getting three days to learn the books and then I'm on on my own  days a week. Am I just overthinking everything or does my manager think I can handle it."
Anxiety,Trigger warning: I have anxiety on developing psychosis or schizophrenia,"So,  years ago, me and my half sister were smoking up, until she started hallucinating. This condition developed into schizophrenia. What happened literally broke my heart, I felt like I’ve lost her forever. Because of what happened, her mom said that we should never see each other again and that’s what my dad did. So, I stayed away from her the past  years. She was the closest friend I’ve ever had, and it was my fault that made her have a psychotic episode. I saw how her features changed, and how she turned into a different person, more like a robot.

This situation, created a new form of anxiety in me. A year ago, I had a bad trip on wed because I was thinking of her and since then I stopped it. I stopped drinking, I developed panic disorder. And my anxiety is kiing me, I feel like I’m hyper focusing on each and every thought in my head. Because I’m afraid I’m developing paranoia and psychosis. I cut off caffeine, I google everything I eat if it can cause anxiety or psychosis. I have fear of sleeping, fear of drinking, fear of orgasm and any form of losing control. Whenever I’m happy I would think about the feeling and wondering if it’ll turn into mania. I can’t enjoy anything in my life. I feel like I’ve lost my ability to do so.

I take medications for depression and anxiety and my psychiatrist told me that I’m on the spectrum of bipolar (I’ve experienced mild hypomania), have ADHD, anxiety disorder and PTSD.

I wish I could wipe some memories away."

Anxiety,How to fix this type of anxiety?,"Basically I hate being complimented. For things like “you’re so funny” etc. It makes me feel like I need to keep this level of funniness for this person or they won’t like me. 

Therefor I lose all sense of “self”. I just have this overwhelming crushing feeling to reach this level of compliment for them and “serve” them in a sense. Weirdest thing. 

Say I have a great run in with someone at a party. Don’t even think twice about it, but we become good friends that night. Well I go to bed with my thoughts racing now looking back at it wondering “Ok so I did this and that and it worked great, perfect, I just have to be that same ‘this’ and ‘that’ tomorrow and it’ll be great.” again falling into this “serving” pattern where I’m constantly trying to reach this expectation. 

What is this and how do I approach it?"

Anxiety,I can't even go to a movie theater date with my boyfriend,"(tw; Brief mention of shootings.) Movie theaters are probably one of my biggest triggers for panic attacks. Last time I went to one, i heard someone's watch ticking behind me and proceeded to shut down for the rest of the film just trying to dissociate from the fear of some sort of catastrophe. Shootings are constantly on my mind whenever I go out, and in movie theaters i just feel so trapped. I know I couldn't get out, and there's no time to react to anything.
My bf took me to my first ever drive in theater last year and I loved it. I felt completely comfortable and safe. Unfortunately, where i live the drive ins close during winter.
Now he really wants to see the new Avatar movie, and I do too! But it's a looong movie and the thought of sitting in a crowded theater for three hours makes me physically ill. But i hate that i can't just enjoy a little date like that with him. And like I said, i really really want to see the film in theaters. Ugh

Does anyone else struggle with this? Help. :')"
Anxiety,What is causing this and how can I tackle it?,
Anxiety,The climate,"There is no major dedicated eco-anxiety subreddit so I decided to post it here. 
I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, which manifests itself in a number of different ways. I have a tendency to overthink and get stuck on various things, and the news serves as perfect fuel for my anxiety. Pertaining to climate change, it’s all doom and gloom. I have a constant sense of existential dread as a result of my worries about the environment and it is extremely difficult to manage, especially in the winter months. Days above  F are becoming more common, and when I look at the weather and see these high temperatures and no snow I just want to cry. I’m fucking terrified and there’s nothing I can do. Sure, there is good news but it’s so few and far between. It’s not enough to convince me that adequate action is being taken. I don’t want to live in a future that is desolate and devoid of life. Hell, it’s even led me to question whether i should take my life. Death at times seems a lot more preferable than living in a state of turmoil, starvation and migration that will be the result of the countless floods, droughts, fires and wars. Optimism is fucking impossible. It’s hard to function. On some days I just want to stay inside and cry, what else can I do? 
The crushing anxiety and existential dread does not help my already poor mental health. 
In my opinion, I feel that I along with the rest of the world are completely, utterly, totally and unequivocally fucked."

Anxiety,Panic Disorder Venting/Advice seeking?,"I have been suffering a panic disorder for a few years now, but my health anxiety is fairly new. Every little ache or pain scares me. I have autism and adhd, so many of my symptoms are most likely a part of these two things, but what is irritating is nothing is ever actually wrong. Life doesn't feel worth living a lot of the time, and I hate myself every time I let a panic episode dawn. I know nothing I worry about is happening and might never happen, and that is the worst part. I am only  and everything I do seems to be wrong, everything I don't makes me feel guilty. It is excruciating. I also have emetophobia and severe constipation. The reason I mention them is they are another factor to my anxiety. I have meds and everything, but my panic attacks usually happen their worst at night. And I usually need to ask someone else to get them for me; general rules. I always feel guilty making them get up and take time out of their sleep just because I can't calm down.

I'm so scared it's just going to end. I'm scared every time she takes a second to respond that I either said something wrong, we are over or something happened to her. She has a decent amount of health conditions that I pretty much no nothing at all about and it scares the heck out of me. She says it's nothing life threatening but it really scares me. I'm literally always anxious about her, about us and just everything. I honestly just want to enjoy what comes with a new relationship, getting to know the person, thinking about them, texting them.

Any that are not listed, please let me know. I add them as I write. TLDR is at the bottom.

I am diagnosed with anxiety since /, and it's getting worse because I refused to be on meds due to the limited selection that worked for me.

So this started months ago. I became friends with a (then) co-worker. A few other co-workers (when I was working there) and I wanted her to know how bad it was to work there because we were all thinking of leaving anyway. We wanted her to find a better place to work before she really committed to the job (restaurant managers sucked really bad). She got out, and never told the managers that we told her about how bad it is. Fast forward a few months, she asked me if I had $ for gas. I only had $. I gave her the money as a loan, hoping she would pay me back. We met at a store and she drove off.

A few months after that (July), I request the $ back through cashapp. Declined. Tried again, same result. This is the time that it all started. I'm not going to get into the details of the texts at that time, but we haven't spoken since. After that fiasco (without the money being returned), a private number starts calling me. This was the first time she leaked my number. It was her group. Calling me, mostly at night, and making really sexual remarks (things that would make a normal person uncomfortable). I kept hanging up, getting flustered at first, then it turned into my heart racing every time they called.

I want to add this here and say I can't go to the police because the number is private.

After going through all that from July to about October, being furious, come November, that's when it slowly turns to anxiety. That is when I stay quiet on my end until they hang up. I've also told them to stop contacting me SEVERAL times before November (that's where the harassment comes in). Throughout November, I started noticing that I'll be sitting in my bed (watching YT, crocheting, playing a game on my iPad, whatever kept me busy, having a normal resting heartbeat. Then the call would pop up, and my heart will start racing like I just sprinted like my life depended on it. That is how bad it got.

I moved into a place on Veteran's Day. I decided to order Dunkin' Donuts through Doordash. Who do I see pop up as the dasher? HER. The one who owes me $. I would've requested a new dasher if there was a way to. That was //. Now she knows where I live and I have become afraid for my life at this point, because she now knows where I live. I can't leave my own home without someone with me because I have no idea what their intentions are. I found out yesterday (//) that she leaked my number AGAIN on a website for single people to talk to each other (she knows I'm not single). The calls haven't stopped (calling several times).

My fiance knows all of this. He even got involved. But, down to the main point. After yesterday's (//) long panic attack from my phone ringing, I have since been scared to do anything. I was thinking about going to see someone to get anything to calm my anxiety down, even if it meant the  hour hold if it came to the ER.


After the intense calls of me yelling ""leave me the f alone,"" it wouldn't let up, and I started panicking. This is when my fiance got involved. He was trying to calm me down, while dealing with the ah. He told them to leave me alone. Asked them if they could hear me panicking in the background (full on hyperventilating, screaming ""make it stop"" every time my phone rang). They finally stopped right before midnight. Even after he got involved, when the phone was not ringing, I could hear my phone's ringtone playing over and over, on repeat, in my head. The hyperventilating got so bad, I was about to pass out.

I've given up on getting the money back. I'm scared to leave my own bedroom at night, even though I know the doors are locked.

I wrote this in  minutes because I needed to take a few steps into another room for private business.

It's :am. My phone is on Do Not Disturb. I have to send an email to my college Advisor to let him know that I will not be answering phone calls due to a severe anxiety attack.

If you would like to post resources, except therapy, I will take anything given. I just needed to get this out there because my anxiety is acting up when I try to close my eyes for sleep

Anxiety,Neuropathy or anxiety?,"Hi, I got diagnosed with what the doctors think is a kidney infection. I got started on antibiotics and noticed a tingling feeling and it started getting worse.  Then I saw the side effect of the antibiotic could cause permanent neuropathy. At that point I started to panic and my doctor changed my medication, but this medication also had the same side effect. I took it for one day and again it got worse. I went to the hospital and everything seemed fine besides the infection but they were not sure of that. Anyways I have been on this new antibiotic for  days and now my feet and hands are tingling and my arms and feet are throbbing in pain. I am wondering if this is just anxiety from my fear of developing neuropathy or could it be something more. It is pretty much constant but the tingling moves from feet to hands. I am going back to the doctor today but am so scared of this not going away."

Anxiety,Hello,
Anxiety,How to find relief from anxiety?,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety for  years and it’s never been like this before. I have had anxiety for no reason before, obviously, but it’s a constant / feeling in my chest for the last month. Its never been this bad before i’ve always had some break at times but now it won’t stop and I don’t feel mentally anxious, just physically in my chest. Any way I can get rid of this feeling or minimise it?"

Anxiety,Taking a break from joining a grad school due to anxiety,"Decision anxiety is the absolute bitch. I was never like this, used to love my ability to make decisions and stick close to them. I had an aim for the past years, to go to a great program in a subject i liked. I got in, then went through an extreme accident which left down for  months. Now, i was all back up and ready to join when my anxiety went off. Nothing makes sense anymore and i feel i do not even trust my own decisions. It really sucks. I wanted to join the program initially, then decided not too, then again and now again. And through it all i gave myself genuine unbeatable reasons. I dont know if what I feel right now is reliable anymore. I'm can join in  days but for that I'll have to sift to a new country. I don't think I have that in me. Thankfully i can still defer. It sucks to know that I'll be stuck at my home for next  months but i don't trust my decision of going anymore. Maybe it's the thought of being stuck that's the only thing pushing me forward. But there problems still remain. Not sure if it helps my career. Getting old in life doesn't help, i feel like I should done this year's ago. 

 Not sure what to think or what to even believe.

One thing i do know for certain is that i need to get better. Learn and never let this happen again. One day at a time, i need to get my mind under control."
Anxiety,i hate when my friends go out without me,"so lets just start off by saing im quite a social person and im happy with how my relationships with other people are going rn.
i kinda created a group with my  closest friends and we all get along so good. the problem is when they go out together without me i get such a big wave of anxiety i sometimes throw up.
its normal for us to not always go out in a group bcs we are friends together but also we have seperate ""relationships"" with each other outside the group. and i also go out one on one with each of them when i want to. and i understand that they can to and i dont have a problem with it and im not mad at them bcs thats what they can do and i do the same. we still go out together as three.
i just dont know how to handle these feelings that i know are irrational. i feel like they are going to leave me and that im always the second choice even though they prove to me that its not the case. i just want to live happily and be content with the fact that we're all so close and not feel so bad every time im not there with them"
Anxiety,Heart Anxiety,"Hi all,

I have suffered with health anxiety for most of my adult life.

I'm a  year old male, consider myself to be generally fit and healthy. Quit smoking around  months ago, lead a fairly healthy diet with mostly home cooked food. Physically active everyday in my work and do partake in occasional high intensity sport (mountain biking, squash etc).

I have had some sort of palpations for as long as I can remember. More recently I have developed a debilitating case of cardiac anxiety. I get ectopic beats, some days worse than others, a bounding pulse for absolutely no apparent reason more commonly when I'm sat down or in bed. Persistent chest discomfort, can be anywhere around my ribs, never any strong pains but more like aches and a sort of uneasy feeling.

I'd really like to know if any one else is going through this and any ways you have found to overcome it. Currently finding it really debilitating and finding it hard to think about anything else, it's definitely affecting my motivation at work and my relationships with friends and family as I find it hard to focus or engage in anything.

For medical reference I have had several ecgs, all of which came back fine although one did pick up on my ectopic beats. I have a resting heart rate between - and during intense physical activity upto -. My blood pressure is good. My doctor has referred me to a cardiologist after my most recent ECG to give me some peace of mind but I'm at the back of the list to see them currently which is - months away.

Would really like to get back to enjoying my life and not living in the constant fear that I am currently.

Really looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks"
Anxiety,How do I get the courage to ask my parents to pay for therapy?,"I don't know how to bring up that I want therapy again. And how do I bring this up to my doctor also, that I'm dealing with too much anxiety that I can handle and want to try different medications. I guess I could say that. But how do I break it to my parents? And how do I summon the guts to do it? When I come to the conclusion that I should be on more medication, have therapy, see a psychiatrist, I get too anxious and chicken out and then I go back to thinking I probably can deal with it on my own and I don't need it. I was on a long waitlist to see a psychiatrist, and after months and months of waiting, I cancel at the last minute because of anxiety. How the hell do you get help when you're scared of it? My last therapist told me that we can end things there if I want to because he doesn't want me to feel so bad. Because I told him I get really anxious before therapy and sometimes it lasts for a long time because the next one coming up and it doesn't get easier as I have more sessions. I guess I didn't tell him everything but when he said we should just stop, it made me feel so bad. I'm at a time where I really need it now because I'm going to have to be going outside everyday starting in a week and I'm used to staying in the house /, the thought of having to go outside sucks so much."

Anxiety,How do you guys deal with cheating anxiety?,"I'm normally a very chill person, but lately, I've been consumed with anxiety over analyzing every single interaction I've ever had, trying to tell whether I was cheating or not.

Take this one, for instance. I met with a bunch of high school friends the other night. It had been years since we had last seen each other. There was this girl who wasn't my type back then, but now she had gotten a bit hot. Ever since I realized that, I tried to avoid talking to her too much, since I know my mind was gonna accost me later thinking ""did you talk to her because you where thinking of cheating??""

To make matters worse, she was really nice and chill, so I couldn't just weasel my way out without being rude. By the time I got home, I did touch myself a bit and she came into my head. Obvs my anxiety's been telling me that this was super wrong, and how I'm a horrible person.

I even looked for help online and came across old forums telling you that if you ever touched yourself to a an ig Pic of a girl you know (which Ive done, but mostly to pics of people I barely know, not a close friend), that's totally cheating too. I'm losing my mind.

 Like, I know my gf would tell me that it's totally fine, but it's also a topic I can't bring up to her because it's something that can turn really awkward. I dunno, if my gf had been in the same situation as me, I wouldn't want to hear about it, but I wouldn't consider any of that cheating. I'd rather she get release in private rather than sending them nude pics or something.

It happened with a bang but we can't find out how that bang was able to exist to begin with so I just don't understand it. And this is making me feel so incredibly scared and sad

I believe strictly in science but a close relative of mine is sure that life in itself is caused by supernatural events and that they have been able to recall memories before they even have happened. This makes me question science so much and brings me down this big spiral. I want to believe in science but this makes me doubt so much

Questioning how consciousness can even exist etc etc. I'm having what I feel like are panic attacks thinking about it and I'm just so scared.

TL;DR I question existence since it doesn't make any sense and it gives me panic attacks and makes me very sad and I can't seem to drop it."

Anxiety,( M ) One day this anxiety and overthinking will take my life or I will take my life because of this .,"My social anxiety , general anxiety everything is on it's peak . 

Every bad incident happened to anybody gives me serious anxiety . Reddit , twitter , Instagram everywhere posts gives me serious anxiety .

 I feel anxious every time and I hate this . 

I hate myself .

I hate socializing because I don't trust anybody anymore . I have serious trust issues , I stay away from relationship because I am insecure about myself and I see lot's of negative posts about relationships and cheating and it makes me seriously insecure , I am really suspicious and I keep doubting everyone around me . 

I am really really sensitive and every little thing makes me anxious . 

Even if I feel like suicidal , I think like I am weak and coward and can't face my fears . 

I see on social media and news that something bad happened to somebody and I start over thinking like what if this happened to me , what would have I done in these kind of situations and I get really anxious , specially fighting somebody or having a situation where I have to fight .

Believe me , I am really short tempered person and I don't give a sh\t about anyone when I am in anger but this overthinking sh\t is too much man , too much .

And the fact that everyone have anxiety and they still face them and fight them seriously making me doubt myself .

Anxiety,Can weed cause anxiety?,"This story goes back to September . I was offered a hashish joint by my friend, and I gladly took up the offer as I had smoked it many years ago and had a blast at the time. I found a quiet spot by myself and took a few puffs, and that’s when my nightmare started.

I had a horrible panic attack and my heart rate went up to  bpm along with light headedness and this feeling that I’m about to die from a heart attack at any moment. It took a few hours but eventually the effects wore off but this incident permanently changed me. I never tried weed again, and in fact, just the thought of smoking it again would put me in a state of panic.

Ever since, I’ve had debilitating anxiety issues. I now suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and hypochondria.

I could go on and on about my symptoms and problems, but what I just want to understand is that how did that one incident with weed change the course of my life? Or was it the trauma from the experience? Its as if that experience turned on the “anxiety” switch in my brain."

Anxiety,Managing Anxiety as an Addict,"Hey all,

I am just about  years sober now and also trying to get a handle on my anxiety symptoms now. I have worked my way through just about every possible anti-anxiety med it feels (Buspar, Zoloft, Prozac, some benzos, etc) and am beginning to feel like nothing works. I have bipolar II, OCD, and PTSD and basically it all boils down to me having a tremendous amount of anxiety. It has manifested in me losing hair all over my body and having a general sense of tension that really impacts my life. This has been happening my entire life and while I have sought treatment for it for years it has ramped up in the last few months and I really want to get a handle on it. 

I am currently in therapy (and doing EMDR treatment for my PTSD flashbacks) and also taking a mood stabilizer and medication for migraines that help level my mood a bit. I have taken anti-convulsant drugs in addition to my mood stabilizer and adding them horribly impacted my memory to the point that I would walk into a room and have no idea where I was, so it would be hard to imagine adding them again. I just desperately want to get my anxiety under control if I can.

I am wondering what you all do to get your anxiety under control if you have a history of substance use and are unable to use habit forming drugs like Xanax, Ativan, or Valium, which undoubtedly would help me but I would abuse (there is proof from my previous prescriptions). I want to get a handle on my anxiety so I can make the positive lifestyle changes necessary to really get my anxiety squashed in the long run. I love doing yoga, meditating, reading, and playing music, but my anxiety runs away with me to the point that I often become incapable of doing those things. Throw in a bipolar episode every month or so and I struggle to make it happen.

In short what do you do to manage your anxiety if you have a history of substance use?"
Anxiety,feeling very off,"I haven’t been able to sleep properly for a week (probably because of bronchitis meds).  days ago I had a mild panic attack where I couldn’t stop shaking, had constant hot&amp;cold flashes and felt very nauseous. I calmed down after  hours and got  hours of sleep. I met a friend after that and while we were talking I started to feel like I was floating, like my limbs (especially my head) weren’t attached to my body. My hands kept going numb. I had to push through it and walked back home. The feeling intensified and I started to feel like I was dizzy. I thought sleep would fix things but I wasn’t able to sleep peacefully— I kept going in between states of consciousness and unconsciousness and even in my dreams was fighting to fall asleep. I woke up so many times throughout the night. Now I have a weird pressure in my head and ears, my muscles are twitching and I don’t have the energy to lift a finger. I feel like I don’t have full control over my limbs. I’m still dizzy and feeling like I’m floating and detached from my body. I feel like I can’t stand straight. Every single thing irritates me, I can’t stand loud sounds. The last time I felt this way was a few months ago when I was studying for my finals and it took me weeks to feel better. I don’t want to go through this again. I wasn’t able to do anything— I just laid down and cried and had to watch my parents get more and more upset with my unimproving condition. I don’t know what is what anymore and I have no strength to fight. Is this whole thing psychological? Is something wrong with me? I would greatly appreciate any help."

Anxiety,Need some help and advice,"hi! so currently my exams are ongoing and my anxiety has tripled. i know i should go to a professional but rn i'm so busy with exams i don't have enough time. earlier this year, i was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. i got better with a little better meds and didn't bother to visit again. 

recently tho, i think i may have had a panic attack. i get so anxious from the moment i wake to the moment i reach school. when i get inside the school, i instantly feel better. so what happens is i feel extremely nauseous (like the slightest smell makes me gag, i can't even drink water) i feel dizzy and dreadful. the first day of exam was the worst. i exited the car and almost passed out and barely managed to get just outside the school building and i started puking- it was just bile cause i hadn't eaten anything since last night. was this a panic attack?

anyway, for the rest of the papers, i took meds to help with nausea, it did help but i still feel anxious. i only have two papers left. is there a way to calm my anxiety down?"

Anxiety,Anxiety about going into work,"I am a highschool student that works a part-time job at a grocery store stocking shelves. I only work on Sunday's for  hours. But the thought of going to work and being there for  hours gives me so much anxiety and I don't know why. The only idea I have is that it's the idea of having to talk to people? Like I have to ask a lot of questions at work because I'm relatively new (only been working there for about a month or more). I shouldn't be worried about asking so many questions because they are always so nice, understanding, and helpful, but I always fear it before work. But I know that isn't the only reason. I almost hyperventilate and have cried before work because my fight or flight response kicked in and I really didn't want to go. I hate this feeling and I wish I didn't have to feel this way before work. Does anyone have any idea what is making me so anxious and/or how I can get this anxiety under control?"

Anxiety,"I am unable to feel Anxiety, which freaks me out and makes me anxious","Please, please help me out. I don't know what to do. I just want to know what I have and if it's permanent. At this point I think I have fried my brain for good.

&amp;xB;

I have had Depersonalization and Derealization for about  years constantly. The last two years I had no anxiety problems (although, in heinsight, I realized I was very much anxious and panicky, however it was doable, I even forgot I had GAD in those  years)

&amp;xB;

Then,  months ago, I hallucinated, which resulted in me becoming extreme anxious about developing psychosis. A doctor later told me everything's fine, I'm just overly anxious. Anyways, this event put me back in the anxious state I was after I first developed derealization disorder. Anxious about existential stuff, about going ""crazy"", about this being permanent,...  


This was stuff I knew. Although I had trouble calming myself down with thinking ""This derealization is just a defense mechanism, it will go away on it's own, it'll soon be over"", because, in those last two years, I had forgotten I had derealization, and moved on. Now I didn't have any recollection of what it was like to live without it. 

&amp;xB;

And here it gets interesting:

A month after that, I went home from a festival. Anxiety still there, but I kind of ignored it. Eventally, whenever I went to sleep, I got this big wave of anxiety crushing over me, without any perticular reason. Just. Anxiety. Which of course made me anxious.

Eventually, a week after that I started waking up in the night, feeling anxious. I also had this lingering background anxiety during the day. Very subtle, but noticable. I wasn't able to calm myself down from anything I was anxious about. Usally people posting recovery storys and so on, really helped me, now it doesn't affect me at all.

And this is the worst: I think about something which makes me anxious, and then, in the next moment I can just move on like nothing ever happened and the feeling of anxiety is gone. I don't feel anxious anymore. Also, my peak anxiety and anxiety in general feel extremely blunted. Like I really have to focus on it in order to feel anxious. The thoughts are there, but my emotional response is completely messed up. 

Also, today, I don't feel anxiety at all. , eventhough I am desperate,... and somewhat anxious... but I don't really feel it. I have an elevated heart rate, but I don't feel that adrenaline anymore... it's freaking me out.

&amp;xB;

Please, if you have any idea what this is, please, help me. I really am desperate...

Have I really fried my brain for good? Is my anxiety now uncontrollable and/or untreatable? Is it just Derealization?

Back in the day I was able to calm myself down, telling myself my fears are unfounded and unreasonable, now it's uncontrollable... sometimes I feel anxiety, although blunted, sometimes I don't feel it at all.... but the ruminating and intrusive thoughts are always there.

&amp;xB;

Anxiety,How do you get over reading stories about others being misdiagnosed?,"Title says it all, I guess.  I had gone to the emergency room  times and had all the tests done.  I'm not dying of a heart attack, and my BP is fine.  

Yet, Google is packed with stories of people saying they were diagnosed wrong for anxiety, and they had a heart attack. Even after the test.  

I'm just feeding my fear for no reason.  It's mostly because of the / dull chest pain I have.  It goes away sometimes, but it seems like to me to be always there even when gone.  Because I'm thinking about it coming back.  

It sucks. LoL"
Anxiety,"Has anyone here ever experienced a ""social hangover""?","Does anyone here also get a really bad internal feeling the day after socializing?

I experience this often and it's horrible. Personally, I spend the next day or the rest of the week thinking about everything I said, things I shouldn't have said, etc. Also, I always get the feeling that people may have judged something I've said as too nonsensical, childish, or ridiculous. The biggest problem is that all this causes a very peculiar distressing feeling, kind of self disgust mixed with regret. Has anyone here gone through this?

Anxiety,Hyper-vigilance,"I have pretty strong anxiety. I guess social anxiety is generally more accurate but it is so strong it affects me even when I am all alone.

I always feel like I have brain fog. I’ve tried many drugs, many supplements, I do therapy semi frequently. Therapy does help but other than that nothing but strong addictive drugs really helped me. But the cons definetly outweigh the pros with that stuff.

I am coming to finally realize my brain fog is related to or is a result of my constant hyper-vigilance about what I think others think of me. 

This hyper-vigilance uses a ton of my brain’s much needed resources. I think that due to having such a shortage of brainpower, I am finding myself in a lot of difficulty. I screw up a lot at work and I am unable to enjoy myself in social situations.

I hope to achieve a state where I have some cognizance of what others think of me but I am okay with them having negative opinions. I seem to vastly overestimate the threat posed to me by others.

I was bullied at a fairly young age and I watched my entire class ridicule and laugh at me. This is the genesis of my trauma.

When I started getting bullied I had no idea how to respond to the adversity and went into fight or flight. I had no idea how to fight and I couldn’t run away so I just froze and allowed my classmates to torture me while my heart sunk as I watched more and more of them join the ranks of the tormentors. Frozen in fear, angry and hating myself.

I learned to fight and became somewhat violent as a teen and thought i was being a man and fixing things. But honestly nothing got fixed and the  year old writing this is essentially the same as that rd grader being mocked and laughed at.

The more I think about it the more I realize that maybe the root is in this idea that my classmates teasing me actually posed some kind of threat. When I really think about it my strongest fear comes from the thought of being put down, made fun of, or being bullied. The same exact situation which started this.

When I am confronted with a real threat, like someone being violent or actually threatening me I can and have risen to the occasion to defend myself.

This has happened before and yet I’m not constantly worried that.

However what I do worry about is mockery.
I actually find myself getting pretty nervous when people are laughing and joking around near me, if I’m not directly involved in the humour. I think that I am fearing that laughter and mockery being turned on me.

The more I think about it though is that laughter and mockery is not actually any kind of a threat. The most powerful and successful people on earth are mocked endlessly. That mockery doesn’t seem to hurt them!

Even Jesus.

To be anyone of value on this earth, being mocked is likely a prerequisite.

Mockery, being made fun of,  laughed at, was and is not a threat. Wish I realized this  years ago."

This just seems reoccurring and I’m on day two of not eating. It’s January First, I have no insurance and I’m in a city I’m not familiar with at the moment. 

I’m at a loss and it’s so scary to me because it’s all of a sudden. To clarify,  I’ve had anxiety before but just the typical normal anxiety, not this % negative and overall doom and gloom feeling.  Any advice for me? Should I go to the hospital for the eating issue?"

Anxiety,"Help, any suggestions or advice on this?","[F] in th grade i believe i developed a weird odor. everyone started asking me if i farted or saying it smelt like fart or poop every where i went. it wasn’t all the time but my friends would make the comments, and strangers sometimes even the whole class. and sometimes my sister at home. i got comfortable with my bf because he never made the comments until one day he did when it was just me and him in a car and i literally wanted to die. i knew that if everyone i knew said they smelt poop or fart sometimes and i’m THE ONLY ONE who can’t smell a thing then it had to be me and most of time they would be so dramatic and i just would want to curl up in a little ball and just disappear. it’s been  years and for the life of me i can’t make new friends because i get so insecure and i think that everyone knows i stink. im not even as close with my family anymore. i use to be a social butterfly now i can’t speak to somebody without freaking out in my head. when i would get a day with no comments and my friends all in my face (when i had friends) saying nothing or a stranger telling me i smell good, i would just say that it’s in my head i just prayed everyday that it wasn’t true that it was a coincidence but then it would happen again. i told my mom and she said it was in my head. i got brave and asked my friends and they said it was impossible but then the next day would say it smelt like fart right to my face. now i get triggered by coughing literally everything triggers me . i start thinking why are these people walking so far away from me? literally anything gives me so much anxiety.  i want to go to the doctor but i’m so scared and embarrassed and i think they would just tell me it’s in my head. ive tried alot of “cures” from online i’m so lonely now and have no friends i just wish i didn’t have to go through something that’s so bizarre. i missed out on the most important years of my life now im  and live the most boring life. i don’t know what forum to put this in hopefully you guys can help."
Anxiety,Sudden onset of panic attacks while driving….again.,"I have struggled with panic disorder since I was . When I get a really bad attack I hyperventilate and my muscles will stiffen specifically my hands, dizziness, and uncontrollable shakes. It’s a terrifying experience.

I’ve pretty much gotten over my overall panic disorder with the exception of one major trigger.  Driving with people in the car.

The last  months I’ve had  and I’ve had to pull over. That hasn’t happened in years. And this is with family, people I should feel the most comfortable with.

Does anyone have tricks on how to manage this one trigger? It’s so overwhelming and I feel like I can’t escape and plus it’s incredibly dangerous trying to drive with hook hands, haha."

Anxiety,"I have been suffering from shortness of breath for months, but my blood pressure is always normal","The doctor prescribed me an beta blocker, I took it for two days and it was difficult for me to concentrate and it didn't help me at all. as many times as I have checked my blood pressure, it is always normal and in general I don't feel that my heart is racing.

I started having this problem after I went off Lexapro in February of this year. Then this stuff helped me a lot and I had a completely different kind of anxiety, which I got rid of with the help of lexapro. Somewhere in one or two months since quit, I felt shortness of breath, which comes with fatigue. I have to lie down, and what the body demand for is to breathe deeply, abnormally. At this time I feel relax and my energy returns. After a while I get tired again and I have shortness of breath and I have to lie down on the bed, I can't do anything else when I can't breathe, I can't think, I get irritated and nervous.

What I have done so far is that, I have started taking Lexapro and had been taking it for  months again, but this drug has lost its effect. Trazodone also lost its effect, I think it works worse. I took lexapro again for  months and stopped it, during this period I was fine for a week, my respiratory failure also passed, but then somehow it started again. I also increased the dose, but it didn't help.

I get worse after eating and after smoking, especially after smoking. I quit smoking for two months in the summer, but I still had this problem, that's all. I do not know what to do. I should go to the doctor somewhere in  weeks, but I have lost hope.

Exercise makes it worse. Breathing exercises are also just temporary. I have been taking mirtazapine for the third week now, my sleep has improved, but my shortness of breath is bothering me again."

It's a long story but to sum it up, I recently went through a messy breakup and we are now splitting time with our dog who has been an emotional support animal to me plus work and life in general is stressful. I go to therapy once a week, but my anxiety has been so bad that nothing seems to be helping it. I can't focus on anything, my heart has been racing all day, I feel sick to my stomach, and no matter what, I just can't seem to calm down. I feel like I'm stuck in a prolonged panic attack right now and it's extremely debilitating. I do not take medication for it. Any advice on how to cope right now or somehow calm my nerves?"
Anxiety,Sort of a bitch when calling out my boyfriend's friend last night,
Anxiety,i ruined new years with my anxiety,"i have been sick for the past year. horrible horrible anxiety, which i've struggled with my whole life, but i truly have never hit a low point like this in my life. i have crippling anxiety every time i have to go out to a party or bar, and every small inconvenience or problem sends me into a spiral of horrible panic attacks that sometimes last for hours. 

my boyfriend and i have been together for almost  years. he is a social butterfly, he loves partying and drinking and all the rest. i've gotten myself to go to a few parties this year with him (with the help of weed and beta blockers) and I did okay, but there were also a few times i had massive panic attacks. 

we decided to go out downtown for new years, and before i could even leave our pregame a panic attack erupted inside of me. i couldn't stop throwing up, i felt so tense and my heart was going a mile a minute. my boyfriend decided it was best if we just went home.

the biggest problem is my boyfriend doesn't get it and doesn't really try to understand it. he knows i've been struggling. he's never dealt with anxiety or depression. to be fair, when we met we were both in university and would party together all the time. my mental health was really good back then (i had genuinely thought i was ""over"" my anxiety at that point) so we never had to talk about it. he admitted he was upset with me last night for ruining the night. he said that i just shouldn't come if this is going to happen. tried to make the best of it and put on some of our favourite shows and talk to him but he was barely speaking to me all night. 

i know this isn't my fault, but i can't help but feel like i've become a burden to our relationship (and my other relationships). i love him so much, i don't know how to make him understand. sometimes i wish i had something actually wrong with me so i had a better excuse for why i can't do things."

Anxiety,Anxiety feels like psychosis,"I used to never have any problems with anxiety but recently a lot has changed in my life. I lived in one house my entire life until my parents got a divorce and me and my dad had to move into a trailer. Around  months of living this new lifestyle I had a really bad anxiety attack, I thought for sure I was going crazy and these were the first symptoms of schizophrenia, this feeling only worsened my anxiety. This happened after I smoked a strain of weed I’m not used to smoking. Now sometimes out of nowhere I get little anxiety spikes where I feel as if I’m going schizophrenic but I have no symptoms of schizophrenia. The anxiety is so bad that I feel like I am going crazy and this thought sends me into anxiety attacks. I know I’m fine but sometimes it’s really hard to control the thought process when I’m having anxiety. Does anyone else feel this way?"

Anxiety,Does anyone have an irrational fear of large objects that could topple over?,"I was just in Costco, and sweat my ass off after passing by the outdoor furniture set. There was this large outdoor gazebo, that wasn’t sturdy or secured to the floor and it just made me nervous. There was an outdoor swing, that again wasn’t secured properly… Then I had to go past the indoor furniture section, which was a terrible idea. They had these bedroom dressers that were some of the most dangerous ones I have ever seen. You bump into one and it shakes. And the living room entertainment center made out of wood could EASILY kill someone. They had these outdoor marble statues that could easily injure someone with a gust of wind. 

I think Costco just makes me nervous in general. I’d rather spend x more and grocery shop at a rite aid or CVS. At least it’s peaceful there"

I’m not ready to go back into the world. I’ve been going through an awful depressive episode for the last few months, trying to change medication but you know how that is. Recently went off olanzapine to switch to seroquel, and my psychiatrist plans on switching from Prozac to paroxetine(for extreme anxiety and panic attacks). My psychiatrist has also talked to us about possibly replacing lamictal with something else.

I had no anxious or allergic reactions to my first  (Pfizer) but did feel weird after my rd (Moderna) but in retrospect was most likely panic. I'm thinking about getting the Pfizer Bivalent booster but now that I'm worried about anaphylaxis and how it can be hard to distinguish from panic I was interested in whether you can get anaphylaxis to a later dose if you didn't get it previously? Bonus points for info about whether it can cause myo/pericaditis later too. Thanks!"

I always tell myself that I am fine and I am ok, but having both weed and tobacco widely available, it makes me feel secure again.

Sometimes, I could just be sitting at my desk watching a video on Youtube and out of nowhere, I get this sudden sense of dread and like something bad is about to happen. It's happened so many times to me and when it does, I usually have to lie down because then I start feeling like I can't breathe properly.

It's just so frustrating that I can't even feel safe/secure in my own room. And even when I'm trying to actively rest or enjoy my free time, I just feel so restless and jittery. It's come to a point where I can't even enjoy reading a book because my body feels so on edge and I feel like I need to be doing something else to completely occupy my mind.

Anxiety,Does anyone else get extremely cold before a panic attack?,"As a kid I used to LOVE the cold, even prefer it to heat. However as I’ve come into my anxiety in the past few years, I can’t be exposed to cold temperatures (especially cold air that’s blowing on me like from an AC or fan) for very long before I succumb to a panic attack.

It begins as my teeth slightly clacking from shivering and that well-known pit in the bottom of my stomach. If I do not remove myself from the situation and warm up, then my teeth clacking will turn into full blown shivering shakes—like I’m hypothermic or some sht. And then I shake and start to hyperventilate and thus begins the attack.

I know changes in body temperature and anxiety are linked. I’m not looking for solutions, I’m just curious as to whether anyone else experiences something similar.

Thanks!"

 I can cure my anxiety.
 I can conquer my anxiety.
 I can heal my anxiety.
 I can dissolve my anxiety.

I haven't taken benzos before. The closest I've come are opioids - morphine and codeine (nasty compound fracture). 

What will benzos feel like? Should I expect any unpleasant / annoying side effects? How am I best to take them safely (I'm conscious of their addictive properties)?"
Anxiety,"so I'm not sure if this is allowed, but I'm reposting this from NarcissisticAbuse since it seems relevant to my anxiety as well, but is what this person is doing anything concerning or is it not? since I'm not sure",
Anxiety,Plz read and comment if u relate or understand,"Im a very self aware &amp; conscious person. Especially of my physical feelings and thoughts. Ever since I quit smoking and got older I really got this different understanding of things and life and different perspective. With that came anxiety &amp; panic attacks bc now I don’t just think selfishly for myself. I Always feel out of it and faint nowadays. I feel everything.  
It’s so hard to convince myself that the insanely fast heart rate, feeling out of it and faint, and very high blood pressure I have in these moments won’t hurt me. If I could get over that fear my anxiety wouldn’t control me as much. It’s just hard to be rational when I feel like I’m actually dying. Ever since I quit smoking weed any different feeling triggers me wether it be I’m tired, sleepy, hungry, dehydrated it all registers in my brain as something worse then the anxiety takes it to another level. Dissociation and the other things are a lot to deal with."

Anxiety,Weird Physical Symptom,"When I'm anxious I get all the common stuff like my heart beating fast, struggling to breathe and nausea but I also get this weird sharp ""ache"" that shoots through my palms, it's like the feeling you get when you've disappointed someone and your stomach/heart drops but it's in my hands. I've looked this up and can't find anything about it and asked others with anxiety but no one I know gets this as a symptom. I'm just wondering why anxiety would cause this, is it something to do with my blood pressure? Plus, I want to know if I'm not the only one who gets this."

Anxiety,Relaxation Anxiety,"I work in a very harsh environment, and what I do for a living isn't for the faint of heart. When I tell people what I do, they say ""I could never do that!"" and see me as a really strong person. 

But whenever I get a chance to relax, which isn't often, I get terrible anxiety attacks, only quelled by distractions like working out or pacing around. I only sleep when I'm physically exhausted or I've had a few drinks.

How do I calm my anxiety when the very cause of it is the supposed solution? Relaxing.

Be keen to hear of any advice or similar experience. I also have ADHD which doesn't help (non medicated)."
Anxiety,"I have no clue if this is the right place to post this question, but why are some people much more comfortable at doing things than others?

Like I am a literal stick, akward mess, smiling super akwardly and genuinely feel beyond uncomfortable. Cannot move to save my life and it just feels so damn awkard I want to puke. However, even if I was ALONE I would not dance, I would experience the same thing and feel super awkward. Yes the presence of people enhances that akwardness, but I would still feel uncomfortable alone. Some people seem to get along so easily, have fun and decent chats, cheers with their drinks and stuff, yet this makes me feel so out of place, how can they do this? Like it seems so natural, and some people like me or my past freinds are just very, idk, not natural, like we feel out of place, I look at these people like they are a different breed. I probably sound like a lunatic rn but I'm genuinely curious. Does anyone else experience this?

Anxiety,Arm Pain = Heart Attack,"TLDR: right arm ache - concerned?

F - On friday i had some pain in my left leg. Nothing serious, felt like I hyperextended or pulled my hamstring. Freaked out all day thinking it was a DVT, woke up Saturday and it was gone.
However, starting Saturday (yesterday) my left arm was aching. Nothing severe, and honestly when I was out doing stuff I didn’t feel it much. Felt the ache while resting/laying down. Now today, Sunday, my RIGHT arm is aching. The whole thing just feels sore/achey while I’m just sitting here. The pain does NOT increase or change when I move my arm, I’d actually say I feel it less when moving? Sometimes it just aches and sometimes I feel sharper “shooting” pains quickly in one certain spot.
I have been freaking out as I googled “arm pain” and almost everything says heart attack. I have no chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, etc. Other than the random arm ache, I feel fine. The pain isn’t severe, moreso just uncomfortable.

Thoughts? I am a hypochondriac and have self diagnosed so many things but the physical symptom of pain is just making me question myself."
Anxiety,DAE had a thought of literally losing control of thoughts that comes to your mind?,"I recently just recovered from anxiety attacks and I was quite happy again because I recognized what causing my anxiety. But last night I realized that my anxiety is so severe that I can just believe on my worries very easily. At the same time I suddenly experienced racing thoughts like literally a hurricane spinning and the ""what if"" thing popped into my head again. I got this thought of ""what if I lose control on every thought that comes to my mind"", ""what if I got depressed again because of these thoughts"" and I started to imagine myself believing on these weird thoughts and having a terrible panic attack. Now it feels like I'm actually losing control of my mind and starting to believe on my thoughts."
Anxiety,"anxious about going, anxious about regretting not going","Does anyone else have this problem?

The event in question is a party and overnight stay at an old friend's house which is a  hour train ride away from my city (no going home once I'm there). I was never that close to him, but he's one of my bf's closest friends. 

The issue is that there are many uncertainties about the event that are making me anxious. My main worry out of these is sleeping arrangements. Every few months our friend group tends to do a big sleepover at someone's house, and often what happens is they stay up very late but around am I'm just not enjoying myself anymore and I need to sleep but I can't because it's way too noisy and there's nowhere quiet. I don't understand how people can just fall asleep with other people in the room talking loudly. Anyway yeah I end up super anxious for hours and feel terrible the next day, and one of these happened recently and I don't really wanna put myself in that situation again so soon after.

The other issues are that I don't know many people going (possibly only my bf and the friend), I looked up the cellphone service and it seem very patchy for that area, and also there is going to be a lot of alcohol and drunk people and I have very little experience with dealing with that kind of thing, especially with people who I don't know. Also my mum doesn't like the sound of it, and I don't want to make her anxious too while I'm there, especially if I end up not enjoying myself cause then it'll be for nothing.

Basically the advice I need is how to go about making this decision. I always hear the advice that you're more likely to regret not taking an opportunity than taking it, which makes me feel bad about not going. But to be honest with myself, it doesn't seem like the kind of thing I'd be interested in, and I wouldn't even consider it if my bf wasn't going. At the same time, I'm worried it's just anxiety holding me back and I should do it to prove to myself that I can."
Anxiety,why do my anxiety subside when i am not alone while sleeping?,"I have noticed this many times.

What are your thoughts about it?"
Anxiety,"Over the top anxiety led to skipped heartbeats, PVCs, anxiety (somatic) cough","It all really came down to stress response… Overthinking constantly, major life changes and and constant worry drove my body &amp; mind into being very weak against stress response…

Anxiety,If I could use some emotional support right now I’d appreciate it/advice. I’m a bit suicidal (not going to act on anything though).,"This past week: been experiencing upper left pain (it’s more so a dull ache) in my stomach and middle left part of my stomach also. Been feeling fatigue, dizziness, my stomach has been rumbling a lot. There’s also been a slight heaviness on my chest and I have no idea why. 

I think it my be a stomach ulcer (which those can be deadly if there’s acid in your lungs/blood stream). Parents have been dismissive and I’m expected to move in a week to school (I want to go to get away from my mom). I’m genuinely am not feeling great. 

Had a pretty intense fight with my mom and sister (they’re both the most mentally abusive people in my life - my mom discounts/belittles me when I tell her to stop doing certain things that hurt me and gets very manipulative + my sister turns into a tirade and just screams/yells + belittles me in the worst ways possible. It makes me want to kill myself at times.

Does anyone else have this and if so how do you deal with it? I’ve even told them recently that this habit is overwhelming but it’s not like I can control someone, and change doesn’t happen over night.

i’ve had about  panic/anxiety attacks in the past  hours over this pain. i have health anxiety, so anytime i feel any bit of physical pain my mind immediately goes to the worst case scenario. i don’t know if i should go to the hospital, or what to do.

Anxiety,Will Hydroxyzine help me with my flight anxiety?,"I have an extreme anxiety of heights, i literally would hyperventilate just looking at tall buildings or clouds when I was little.

Obviously I’m also freaked out because there’s just so much distance between me and the ground and i have no way of getting back down until the flight ends. I’ve been on Prozac for about  years now taking it everyday and it has helped so much with the general anxiety. I’m  years old now and I’m a big ass dude (’  lbs). I have never been on a flight before but my doctor prescribes me hydroxyzine for this flight that i have day after tomorrow with my friend and his family. My doctor told me to take a mg pill and then take another one  minutes later and that should calm me down. I tested it here at home and honestly the mg didn’t really do much. I felt a little tired but i was wide awake and still couldn’t imagine the idea of me being ,+ feet in the sky. I’m thinking i should take mg of the hydroxyzine all at the same time, an hour before the flight takes off ( mg pills). Idk what effect this will have on my body but I’m hoping it will help me on this flight. Also the flight is  hours long so not too bad but still not short. Does anyone have experience with a similar fear or experience with taking hydroxyzine to calm you down a little? All input helps I’m just so goddamn nervous."

Anxiety,Anxiety is slowly ruining my life...,"I don't really know what I am aiming for in this post, I mostly want to share my recent experiences and would love to talk with people with the same experiences. 

I've had anxiety for the better part of my life, starting since I'm in middle school and it has slowly gotten worse and worse, I assume that it kicked off from a traumatic event I had around that time, it started with just being awkward in public spaces and twitching my legs and hands, and eating my nails, which I still do, to then some years later feeling the need to pee when I'm in public spaces or when I'm around a lot of people, to now having nausea on top of that. But these are just the symptoms, having these practically every single day has been making my life a living hell, I can't hang out with friends or go to the store or just walk around the park because i start feeling awfully anxious. 

I started college  year ago and was thankfully blessed to have to do a semester online because of the pandemic still present at the time, but once those restrictions were lifted I had to go there and it was awful. Like the worst months of my life, I barely made it through that, constantly thinking about suicide just to get it over with. I tried explaining this to my parents who took me to a psychologist and when they said that i should start taking anxiety reducing pills my parents just didn't like that and didn't have the chance to get my hands on them, and so i started another semester of college, this time i just couldnt stand it and I haven't gone to a single class in the entire semester, I tried but I just don't have the strenght, I haven't told my parents because I'm too scared of what they might say, when just telling them that I wanted to drop out some months ago made them mad. 

At this point I don't know what to do, my anxiety just gets worse as time goes on, I try explaining it to my parents and they don't believe me, they think I should just toughen up and get over with it already but I just can't, no matter what i do. 

These last few months that I haven't gone to college have been great... without worrying about my parents for a while or having to be around people for some time was really nice. I've been developing my art skills for  years now and I really think it's most likely the only thing I can do in life.

I feel like a dissapointment to my parents and to everyone else, and I really can't see how i can go on like this..."
Anxiety,Go back to therapist or find new one?,
Anxiety,tips for anxious people,"Hello everyone.
 I have been aware of having anxiety for a year;  It turns out that since I was little I was an anxious girl and my whole life has been based on repressing emotions.
 Throughout  I had psychological and psychiatric help to control panic attacks and, without mentioning medication, I leave you with some things that have really helped me.
 .- Smells.  Keeping a lavender-scented roll-on on hand and using it when I start to feel bad helps reduce many symptoms
 .- Stuffed animals.  Believe it or not, taking a stuffed animal with me (whatever size it is) makes me feel accompanied
 .- Meditate.  I have to admit I was skeptical about it, but meditating for even  minutes a day makes all the difference.
 .- Textures.  A fidget, an anti-stress toy, a clicker, a pop it, whatever, having it on hand makes you ""already know"" what to do with your hands in a difficult situation
 .- Be kind.  Being kind to yourself is the best thing to do when you're surrounded by people who don't understand what you're going through.  Remember to talk to yourself nicely and be patient with your process because no one heals the same way and no one is served by the same things
 .- Today is over.  Whether you've had the best or the worst day, remember that it's over.  What had to happen happened and no matter how it happened, that's how it had to be.  You can no longer do anything to change what happened and you can't plan for the future either.  If you are like me who is terrified of the future, repeat: I will worry when things happen, not before.
 .- Sleep.  Please sleep, I know it's hard or sometimes you don't sleep all night;  but having a good night's sleep will make you a completely different human being in the morning.
 .- Take a shower.  Yes, take a bath.  It relaxes you, makes you feel clean, bathing is an act of self-love.  Use a soap that you like its aroma and try to give yourself a last soak in the back before leaving.
 .- Give yourself prizes.  Especially if you did something very difficult or something that took you out of your comfort zone;  either with a sweet or a delicious meal or free time or something that you like a lot.
 .- Breathe.  Fill your lungs, breathe in , hold in  and release in ;  this will normalize your breathing and help calm your heart rate.
 Hopefully some of this can help someone who is having a hard time."
Anxiety,Anyone else obsessed with the mistakes you make at work,
Anxiety,My anxiety is disrupting my life. I need to vent/ receive advice,"Normally I would refrain from posting this on any form of social media, but I am truly at a loss right now. 

My anxiety has increased quite a bit within the past few months. It gets so bad to the point where I am having frequent panic attacks. I also don’t want to be super open, but it’s the only way I can explain my situation. 

I keep having reoccurring thoughts that any little sensation, pain, feeling that I have in my body is something like a blood clot or a disease forming and that I am going to die spontaneously. I’ve also started to notice my skin will itch and crawl and it will feel like my arms or my legs are falling asleep. I don’t know if it’s hyper vigilance, but even when I am sitting down or lying down, I can feel my heart thumping in my chest. It doesn’t feel like it is beating hard, but I can still feel it.  All of these feelings come and go in waves. I’ve noticed it hits me later on in the day. 

I also continue to think that I have a disease when I know that I am healthy physically. Ive been avoiding any kind of substances/stimulants purely because I do not want these feelings to be exacerbated. 

My girlfriend told me I have been tossing and turning in my sleep and breathing very hard. 

I am not asking to be diagnosed by people on Reddit and I am planning on going to my doctor for this issue. I just need to vent and see if other people have ever experienced things similar to this. It is such a draining experience and I don’t wish it upon any person."
Anxiety,"If you have a partner who does not have any mental health issues/anxiety, how do they react to when you are having bad anxiety or even day to day anxiety? Are they supportive?","My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year, this is my first “real” boyfriend. I have OCD anxiety and depression, but ocd and anxiety take over my life more than depression because I only go in and out of depression funks every so often. My boyfriend does not have any mental health issues or anxiety. He handles stress very well and generally has a good hold of his emotions. Very shortly into the relationship I opened up to him about my anxiety just so he was aware of what I’ve been dealing with for the past + years. He has been nothing but supportive over it. At the end of the day he can’t totally relate because he doesn’t have anxiety but is always very comforting to me when I am going through bad anxiety. I had my first big panic attack  months ago and he was there with me, I truly thought I was dying. It was the worst day of my life. Besides that I’ve been pretty good and haven’t had major panic attacks but day to day I deal with anxiety a lot. I’ve accepted that I’m going to have anxiety forever but just take things day by day. I did have a small panic attack when we were on vacation and he was extremely supportive, he wanted to make sure I was comfortable and did whatever he could to calm me down. I’m very grateful for him. It’s just very weird being with someone who doesn’t have anxiety because I truly can’t imagine how that feels lol but thank goodness he is doing the best he can when he knows I’m going through it. How about you guys? How does your significant other react to when you have anxiety if they don’t have it?"

Anxiety,Anxiety over fire alarm,"I live in an apartment complex with my boyfriend and last night the alarm went off at  AM. Whole building had to evacuate n i had a full blown panic attack, like the alarm was INSANELY LOUD, n now i’m terrified it’s gonna happen again :( Cant calm down"

Anxiety,Just Venting…,"Long story short: I am (or at least was) super excited to be planning this trip to California with three of my best friends (we’ve been best friends for over  years, each one us lives in a different country and this is the first time the four of us are getting together in over a decade). It is a big deal.

So the stupid me decided to go on the San Francisco community here on Reddit and ask what would be the best area for us to stay in San Francisco (this is the first stop, and I’m charge of our itinerary). 

Now, here’s what happened: EVERY SINGLE COMMENT on my post was full of sarcasm, annoyance, judgement and rudeness.

I get it, it is annoying when a tourist wants to ask questions and do touristy things. I get it, people ask this same questions multiple times a day, everyday and I could have gone to some link that would give the answer I was looking for. I get it, they got mad at me because I said “SanFran” and not San Francisco. I get all that. Now here’s what I think:

One day, you might wanna visit my country. And guess what? You’ll be asking annoying questions and doing touristy things. You’ll might wanna do some online research, and if you’re not very tech savvy like myself and don’t even know that there’s a link you can use to avoid annoying people with this question, they will be mean to you. If you’re not local and use a popular slang when you’re referring to your destination, like so many other people do, God forbid - you’re going straight to hell.

And the stupidest thing of it all, is that people feel so much pleasure putting other people down, they itch so much to be these anonymous arrogant assholes behind their phones, that they would much rather type a long ass hateful message then to just simply replying “Union Square”. Definitely A LOT less characters. 

Anyways, I needed to vent. I struggle a lot with my mental health, and now I don’t wanna go to CA anymore. I’ll talk to my friends so we can meet up somewhere else."

Anxiety,anxiety attack paralyses me,I sabotaged my career because anxiety attacks make me not want to live my life anymore. They are like dementors in Harry Potter. They suck the living energy out of me and leave me with zero motivation to get anything done. My thoughts are clogged and foggy. I have no idea how to get away from this. My anxiety attack always wins. I am never able to suppress it. Once it hits me i feel paralysed. I couldn't move. It makes me dizzy. It makes me restless. It makes my head spin. It makes me sleepy/ tired. I hate living my life like this.

So I’m celebrating my first birthday far away from family and friends.

I moved to an other country to live with my partner. I don’t have any genuine friends of my own yet although it’s been  months. (Language barrier is tricky sometimes)

So outside the normal pain of aging i just miss my native country friends and family. 

What i can tell i have no rational thinking for why the anxiety triggered. It is just as you probably know the feeling in the chest and mental exhaustion. 

Any coping tips? I wanna be well for when me and my partner try to throw a birthday gathering the upcoming weekend.

Otherwise hope ya’ll have a lovely day!"
Anxiety,F. Memory loss caused by fear and vice versa.,"TLDR; I’m at my wits end with a recurring issue surrounding a phobia of getting injured or more specifically my phobia of getting injured then developing a phobia surrounding a skill. Looking for mechanisms to take control of my brain when my brain highjacks my body. 

Im hoping someone can help me and/or explain this problem I have. It’s a bit of a long explanation but I feel like it’s necessary to fully paint the picture. 

For context; I have GAD, OCD, ADHD, depression, ASD and suspect that there’s something dyslexia-esque going on too (but can’t afford to take the suspicion to a psychologist). I take mg of escitalopram daily and just about rely on Ritalin to get anything done. 
Even with my long list of diagnoses, I have this gut feeling like there’s something being missed, but that’s for another day. 

So:
After badly fracturing wrist cheerleading, I have developed a phobia or “mental block” towards tumbling (flipping). Since the accident I’ve repeated the same cycle over and over again; I dedicate myself to getting over the fear, I make progress, then with no apparent cause I am back at square one completely unable to do even the most basic, safe version of the skill. Nothing will change, I could have just done the skill  times in a row but I’ll go to do the th and I just can not do it. 

It’s a feeling similar to fear (legs shaking, rapid heart beat, sweaty) but I’m not necessarily afraid of the skill- I just can’t do it. Like, my brain does not have the tools to understand what I need to do to do the skill. It’s as if someone’s just told me to get behind the controls of an aeroplane or to perform brain surgery. I simply don’t have the knowledge of how to do it. 

I love skateboarding and face the same challenge. I’ll perform a trick perfectly then with no apparent cause it’ll be gone. For example; I’ve never had any issues with dropping in then with literally no reason, a few weeks ago I got to the skate park, set up at the top of the half pipe and poof! Gone! I’m looking down the ramp and it’s as if my eyes don’t know what I’m looking at. Like literally rubbing my eyes trying to make them focus but it’s like I just can’t comprehend where the ground is or how high up I am. I moved down to a smaller ramp thinking maybe I just wasn’t ready for dropping in to the big ramp but nope- exact same feeling on the small ramp. A complete loss of understanding as if someone has wiped my memory. Almost as if i go into some sort of fear coma or have temporary amnesia. 

I have identified that a big part of the issue is that I am afraid of the possibility of getting hurt. Breaking my wrist tumbling put an end to my tumbling career so I suppose my brain connects getting hurt with never doing what hurt me again. Some ooga booga survival instinct which is fair enough. But I can’t seem to find a way around it. Even with all the safety gear on in the world I’ll be in the same boat. 

A few frequently suggested solutions I’ve received over the years would be:
-“Just do it”.  I can not physically force myself to do whatever I’m freaking out about. I feel like I can’t tell my own brain what to do when I get in these states. 
-“Take it back to step one and work your way back up”. This has some merit as it helps me slowly regain confidence but its frustrating to be going back to square one once a month for  years straight, so I’m a bit over this method… 
-Ive tried “changing my mindset” and other internal strategies. These don’t help because I don’t feel like I “am my brain” when I’m frozen. No matter how firmly I believe something, once I’m in fight or flight it goes out the window. Meditating doesn’t work, hypnosis doesn’t work, having a “more positive attitude” is BS.


Saying all of that might make me come across as stubborn towards trying to improve but it’s simply out of frustration. This has been going on for so long now that I know which methods (mentioned above) are a lost cause and what tends to trigger a “freeze” (forcing myself to “push through the fear” NEVER turns out well”). 

If anyone has any comments, suggestions, questions or answers please speak up!! All I want is to enjoy doing the sports I love without being held back by fear. 
Thankyou &lt;"

Anxiety,Anti anxiety meds,"Hi everyone. I am  and have struggled with anxiety my whole life but after getting CHS just over a month ago, during that time my anxiety was at an all time peak like I’ve never experienced before. Since recovering from the CHS i am still experiencing high levels of anxiety throughout the day like I’ve never before and it gets worse at night. I’ve tried lots of things like walking, deep breathing, meditation, but nothings been really helping. It comes with physical symptoms too like tightness in chest and nausea which is hard to deal with.

 I have an appointment with my family doctor to chat with her about this in a few days. I’m worried about going on anti anxiety medication. I’m worried that I’ll be dependant on the medication. I’m also going to try and see a therapist but it’s about $ a session where i live so I don’t know how many sessions I can afford. I was wondering if anyone has a perspective on my situation or advice, especially about anti anxiety meds. Would help too if you can specify what the name of the med you take is so I can do some research :)"

It is more painful than anything I have ever felt before, which is saying alot because I have been through alot. Lately I have been been getting lots of anxiety attacks and lots of panic attacks. When the anxiety attacks happen, my heart rate goes up and I get a sinking feeling in my stomach and a sense of dread. With the panic attacks, I get overwhelmed and cannot figure out what is going on around me. When I get upset like this I make bad choices and hurt my loved ones. I need help figuring out how to calm down. Deep breaths have never worked for me, except for when my ex was leading them and helping me calm down, but that is not an option now. I plan on visiting a professional in the future.

Anxiety,how can i deal with conflict anxiety?,"hi friends, i was wondering what are some things that have helped any of you with conflict anxiety? for some context, i was diagnosed with GAD, but it typically manifests itself as social anxiety. i am extremely scared of upsetting others. the thought of somebody being mad, sad, disappointed, etc. at me sends me into a very dark place. i oftentimes find myself fixating on whether or not someone could possibly feel upset at me too, even if they do not explicitly tell me that they are or give me any other obvious reasons. it can also occur if there is conflict between people that i know, and just hearing about it is enough to make me feel a lot of discomfort. i also experience debilitating physical symptoms, especially ones that hit my stomach (ache, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea) and it's really bad. this has led me to be an extreme people pleaser, i am unable to stand up for myself or others because it feels safer to ""keep the peace,"" and i have a negative self perception since i beat myself up over mistakes. i wish that i didn't care so much about what other people thought of me or my reputation, but i cannot help it and i am so afraid of being abandoned. i haven't learn how normal (and even healthy or necessary) conflict can be because it wasn't something that was done right in my household growing up. now i am  and struggling really bad to cope with it. has anybody felt similarly, and if so, what did you do to help yourself through it? i'm in therapy doing exposure and response prevention for it, but recently found myself in a situation that has been bothering me. thanks!"

Anxiety,How to politely decline counselling / psychotherapy on email?,"I (F) am actively seeking a therapist for ideally about  sessions for my chronic anxiety. At this age and stage of life I am looking for someone who is primarily focused on promoting mental health and facilitating personal and interpersonal growth and healing.

The practice emailed the rates of the therapist I had in mind and I kindly replied saying thanks so much for coming to back to me but that is out my budget, my budget is “____”. 

They counteroffer me, and suggest a lady just ever so slightly above my budget, which I don’t mind at all. The lady they suggested is an educational psychologist though, which is not what I’m looking for. If I decide to continue with therapy ideally I would want someone who I can connect with and I feel has better interest in the resolutions and issues at hand that is around my budget (it is not unreasonable but as I stay in what is seen as a more “posh” area the therapists and practices around here can get away with charging whatever they like, and so they do).

Don’t want to say that in my email though not sure if I’m overthinking it chances are I am.

Anxiety,Intense anxiety about opening up to people,Whenever people (especially my parents) ask me if anything is wrong or if I'm doing alright I always panic and just say I'm fine even when I'm not. The thought of opening up to someone even my partner or my parents makes me almost sick with dread. Any negative reaction to something I've said in general makes me super anxious even if the reaction is something as simple as a grimace. Anyone else struggling with this? If so do you know why? Have you managed to overcome it and if so then how? I can't personally figure out why and when this started for me but it's something I struggle with constantly. I want desperately to be able to be more open and honest but the anxiety makes it seemingly impossible.

Anxiety,Unexplained pain in the chest,"( M) Unexplained pain in the chest

I ( M) Have been having on and off unexplained chest in the pain since I was . I suppose they  could be  caused by stress. 

They are quite sharp pains, that are felt like something is cutting or tearing me from the inside. 

They do not last long, but recur over a period of time

My assumption is that it is a mental problem, because anxiety triggers them. 

Initially they felt like pains in the heart region, then,when I was told that it could be stomach problems, they relocated in the stomach area. When I was afraid I could get sick with corona I started feeling the pain in the lungs. 

Basically, pain localizes where I'm afraid to feel it. 

The pain goes away when something very distracting happens. 

Conducted medical examinations: x-rays, fluorography, examining the stomach for ulcers - they did not find anything. Blood tests are more or less normal.

what could be causing these pains? if it's mental, how to deal with it? what else can be checked to make sure it's not something physiological?"

Anxiety,"Is it normal to get social anxiety for online things, not just text or phone calls .","Getting anxiety over text or phone calls is normal, but I’m talking about playing a video game and getting scared to type anything into chat or even typing a comment on a YouTube video. I never really exactly noticed when I was younger, just thought it was normal, but I would always watch YouTube videos and never had the urge to read or post any comments. I only realized now because of tiktok , on YouTube or in a video game, typing in chat isn’t necessary or you have to go out of your way to access it,  but on TikTok the chat is one button away and with every other tiktok saying “read the comments for advice on (something something)” reading the comments becomes a necessary part of it. Then I started realizing I got scared and to even type a comment got me scared. It’s kinda odd but I got a little shaky typing this, I’m just desperate and don’t know if this is a normal thing a person with anxiety experiences."
Anxiety,Late Night Vaping Related Anxiety,"Hey guys, having a possible late night anxiety attack and just wanted to get my thoughts out here. I’ve been vaping since freshmen-sophomore year of high school and currently am in my sophomore year of college. I was on Tik Tok and saw a video about a guy who’d been vaping about as long as just recently discovered he was at risk for serious heart disease cause of it. This was hours ago and ever since then I feel a light tight feeling on the left side of my chest. Nothing super uncomfortable but I’ve felt similarly in the past. It hasn’t gone away and i’ve become hyper aware of it. Now it’s sent me into this spiral of anxiety and I can’t sleep. I haven’t hit my vape in an hour or so (forever I know) and I want to quit but im worried the damage is already done and what if i’m too late. Im only  so I feel so young but i’ve had to been vaping for four years now and i’m just scared that i might have permanently damaged something.

TLDR; Late night anxiety attack over vaping and health issues, would just like someone to tell me I’m not gonna die of a heart attack…. or at least give me something honest that’s still kinda reassuring"

Anxiety,Any tips on ignoring physical symptoms?,"Social anxiety sufferer here and recently I've been finding it really difficult to deal with my physical symptom of anxiety. 

The main physical symptom that's been affecting me pretty much this entire time is the frequent need to go to the bathroom even when there isn't a need to. If I'm like relaxing at home it's all good but when I'm outside it just doesn't work out at all. 

My brain understands but my body doesn't. Which ends up being very hard to ignore because the physical symptom would immediately affect and interrupt my thoughts. I've tried breathing exercises, CBT but those still don't seem to be able to override the intrusive thoughts and fears as efficiently. 

I haven't been to therapy for a while now but I do have an appointment coming up (hoping to try with meds as well) but in the meantime I'm hoping to find some other alternatives to this because it's really starting to take a toll on everything."

Anxiety,Just a story about my anxiety.,"Hey, since December  I live in fear of panic attacks and my life is sometimes more sometimes less determined by anxiety. I took Sertralin  mg for several years and I am now at  mg because I want to get rid of it. I don't really feel that like Sertralin has helped me much with my anxiety. More it helped me to not build up depressions. I live in a small city and after years I started a therapy and am really happy that I made this step. I think it will be a long and difficult  journey to heal but I don't want to give up. For  there are some big changes and plans coming up. First I will change my career path after I was in Sales jobs and other departments. The work never give me joy and i thought about what really suits me and made some personality tests (personalities) showing me careers which could suit me better. Hoping to get a new job after my further education. Next step is to move to a ""big"" city and start over. After school I always wanted to move in a big city because I am not a fan of these small cities. I want to force myself to break boundaries and go more amount people. In university my anxiety really got better and things got easier for me. Things I want to reach by that is to find joy in my life again and to find a little bit of inner peace. I want to get my life together and want to experience things and countries again. I turn  this year and feel like my life is so pointless and i don't want to live like that anymore.

Anxiety,Scared  f,"Hi, i was diagnosed with panic disorder in May and I have severe anxiety. through hard work and lots of therapy i have been able to manage it a whole bunch. the physical symptoms still come and go though mostly being nauseous, chest pain occasionally, and dizziness. i’ve been to the doctor in September where they did vitals and didn’t find anything wrong. My sister is a doctor and thinks there’s absolute nothing wrong with me and it’s just anxiety. I have been feeling really great these past couple weeks except a little bit of nausea. Well yesterday I was standing in the heat for about  minutes I started focusing too much on how I could have heat stroke or pass out and I started getting light headed, I immediately went inside with ac and sat down. After about an hour of that I was able to walk around no issues. Well later last night I bent down to let the dog and when I got up I got super dizzy and have been like / dizzy ever since. even when i laid down for a bit it felt like the room was spinning. I am able to get up and make it to the bathroom and sit up on the bed but I still feel a bit dizzy. What should I do to fix this/ what do you think is causing it? Could this all be anxiety? Can’t go to the doctor right now. I’m worried it’s warning sign of heart attack, stroke, seizure, or that i’m just going to drop dead lol. I’m really just confused on how anxiety symptoms could be so physical. Have y’all been through the same?

Anxiety,"Feeling trapped in new job, need advice for daily routine.","I recently started a new job. Working for a larger company from home, as a support rep helping customers get their IT environments running smoothly. 

Part of the employment package was a $, sign on bonus that you have to pay back if you don't make it  months. 

Upon initial employment, I didn't expect this kind of feeling to strike me, and I spent over half of the sign on bonus digging myself out of medical debt. 

Now in the third month of employment, I can't go to bed at night without freaking out because I am afraid that tomorrow I am going to mess it all up and be out of a good paying job. Every day feels like it could be the end of my world and the beginning of more life crushing debt. 

My goal now is to have $, saved up in case I lose the job, so I don't have the thought of ""What if?..."" always floating around in my head. 

It's the kind of job that you always wanted, what felt in the beginning like ""I finally made it"" and now it just feels like I've trapped myself in a place that I'm not comfortable. 

I don't know what to do, every day is hard. I just want to be secure going to work, and doing the things I have to do to get by. 

I wish life wasn't so hard sometimes. 

Everyone else out there having a hard time, I feel for you, and I hope it gets better."

Anxiety,I think weed has made me permanently paranoid,"So I (m) went to visit my cousin this summer break and I tried weed for the first time, I really liked it and had no problems, every time I smoked it was just the pefect amount, I wasn’t greening out or anything. 
  That was until me and my cousin rolled like  grams into one backwood leaf, then I took like  fat hits and it just feels like I wasn’t really the same after that. That day I had the worst experience in my whole life, we went into the city and I just felt like my heart was about to stop any second, we had some fire chicken burgers but I could’t even finish a quarter of it because I just felt like everybody was eye’ing me and it felt like I couldn’t catch my breath or something (it was a really weird feeling, but not in a good way) we went back to our place and I prayed before going to sleep because I thought I would genuinely get a heart attack in my sleep and die. 
   So now Im back in my home-country and ever since that experience it feels like I have cardiophobia or extreme anxiety, because I concentrate on my heart rate every second of the day and if I feel just a bit weird I start freaking out thinking im gonna die from heart palpitations or something, I have called  on myself a couple of times last month, but going into the hospital i was told it was nothing and Im just freaking out, they told me it’s just panic attacks, while I do think, yeah its just panic attacks I really want to fix myself, I dont want to have to worry every second of the day that im gonna die any second from heart failure. I dont know what to do"

Anxiety,Tip! Afraid to take your eyes off a screen because you need constant escapism to soothe anxiety? You can still exercise!,"So my unhealthy approach to anxiety is that I need to be constantly glued to something. YouTube video, podcast, book, crocheting/knitting, etc. When my brain does anything at all it can’t scream at me. This, obviously, is hard to do while exercising. I also don’t like getting sweaty lol. Not to mention exercising out doors, or even doing anything that can be heard by the others in the apartment. Social anxiety ftw.  at the same time I want to exercise. I want to have some definition in my arms. I like feeling strong because goodness gracious I need some strength in my life. 

But! I recently found out that it’s insanely easy to exercise at home without losing that soothing escapism and completely in secret. This is how I personally found success in getting to exercise despite my anxiety. This post is generally aimed at people who don’t exercise, haven’t ever gone to the gym, are scared to start, etc., but who want to exercise. What you need - your favourite form of escapism, preferably a hands free one. A show, a YouTube vid, a podcast, music, etc. That’s it. You don’t even really need motivation it’s that easy. 

You’re gonna put a nice comfy pillow on the ground. Or maybe you have a rug you can sit on, or a yoga mat. Sit on the mat, with your legs stretched straight in front of you. Lean forward until your hamstrings protest. Keep your eyes on your phone. Done! You’re being physically active. You’re stretching. I went from not being able to touch my toes to being able to put my forehead to my knees. All by watching YouTube vids not in my bed but on the floor. 

I’ve went from % of time sitting in my bed and stressing to % of time sitting on the ground, stressing and stretching. It’s actually a lovely change and takes practically  effort. 

Next level of difficulty. Find a dresser, a wall, or the ground if you’re strong enough. Do a push-up while your favourite YouTuber is blathering on about the most recent drama. Can’t do it? No worries, try to do a push-up against a wall. It also counts. It’s all exercise. 

Next level of difficulty. Put on your favourite min long music video. Hold it right in front of your face. Do a few squats.  squats count.  squats count. 

Take a breather by laying on the ground. How nice! Now put on the next brain soothing form of escapism and do some more. Once you’ve convinced your brain that exercising is super easy, do a few more exercises. Maybe check up on some other forms of exercises. 

Turns out that you don’t need to sweat, be loud, take up space, be in public, etc., to exercise. My schedule goes like this - I have (for example) h free time in the evenings. I sit on the ground and read/watch/whatever and stretch for min or until I get bored. I take a break and sit on the ground but don’t stretch for a while. I put on a music vid and do  squats. Oh no, I almost got sweaty! Time to take a break. Then I do some push ups. Oh no, got a bit tired, time to sit on the ground and rest. Rinse and repeat. 

The secret is, if you want to be a bodybuilder you need weights. If you want to just kinda lazily exercise a tiny amount to sleep better, be a tiny bit stronger, have some tangible progress in how flexible/strong you are, you don’t need to sweat, you don’t need to tell anyone you’re exercising. It’s just self care, same as brushing your teeth or putting on your socks in the morning. 

Maybe this seems obvious to y’all. But I always thought that exercising is impossible to do secretly if you live with other people, and that it’s generally a “public” event. I.e. I always thought that exercising is impossible if your anxiety doesn’t want you to go outside your room/be loud/be public/etc.

Happy new years!"
Anxiety,I overcame anxiety after  years of struggling,
Anxiety,Paranoia is terrifying.,"I always get paranoid about people watching me, or think of stupid ideas like “is there a camera watching me?” when i use the bathroom.
even when i leave home i’m paranoid people are watching or talking about me, 
i’m very sure my family hates me even if it wasn’t paranoia.

I constantly have to check in the bathroom in case someone can peek somehow or when I do something secretly, i ensure my safety and privacy.
that is scary. i like privacy."
Anxiety,Trapped,"I don’t know how else to describe this hell other than that I feel utterly trapped. My life at the moment is wake up, have a panic attack, throw up and cry. This is supposed to be a happy time- I got married a couple of months ago to the most wonderful man but my anxiety has morphed into something worse than I’ve ever experienced. The worst part is there are no triggers, nothing in particular has happened that’s proportionate to the way I feel. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep without waking up in panic, and the worst thing is I’m pushing my beautiful, supportive husband away. I sent myself to a&amp;e on Friday because I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack when I woke up. I’ve been on citalopram for years and propranolol more recently for the panic but nothing seems to be working. I truly wouldn’t wish this shit on anyone.

Sorry for the long post- it feels good to let it all out!"
Anxiety,CT brain scan fears,"I am scheduled to have a CT brain scan on Wednesday and I'm stressed about it. I'm less worried about the results, and more about the experience and radiation exposure. For those who have had one, what should I expect? Will I feel anything during or after? It is a no contrast, so I don't have to worry about have a reaction yo that. How worried should I be about the radiation?

For background info, I'm getting the scan because I've been having daily headaches since November th. I have been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks for a couple years now, but have never had headaches from it. I went months without having bad anxiety, but since the end of September it has come back and been consistent, alone with a few bad panic attacks, with the help of multiple life stressors happening one after the other. 

They don't feel like regular headaches. They are like a weird pressure that only lasts a few seconds at a time, but depending how stressed I feel determines how quickly I get the next one. When they kept coming every day, I obviously feared the worst, as I've never had headaches with stress before. It doesn't help that I am a googler, which only made my fears of a tumor or anyerism worse. I got bloodwork done and that came back good, but my GP said that since it had been weeks that's I've had them, she wanted me to get a CT just in case, but assured me that if it was something serious I would have other symptoms, which I don't. 

I'm quite positive that they are % from my anxiety, as the timing would be too coincidental that I suddenly have a tumor while I'm going through all of this stress in my life. I have been working really hard on getting a handle on my anxiety (thanks to the DARE Response) and have been having less headaches over the past couple weeks, a couple days I don't recall even having one. Since they seem to be getting better should I cancel my appointment? Is the scan safe enough to still have just for % verification that I am indeed healthy? I read that the chance of getting terminal cancer from a scan is low, but the odds they stated were  in ,, which doesn't seem very low at all!"

I don't really know how to explain it but have you ever felt like your brain ""tingles"" or ""hitches""? Sometimes I feel discomfort in the right-aerea of the brain (right temple, top-right part of the head) and I have the urge to massage it. When I have these symptoms my anxiety increases a lot and I feel like my head spins and I need to lie down. When I calm down it gets better but I don't really know why this happens. I get a lot of headaches lately and sometimes i feel like having a seizure/passing out... Does this happen to you?

Anxiety,Feeling anxiety today - eye contact and nerves?,"I felt bad today, partly due to my diabetes, high hormone and from alcohol the other day. I forced myself to go out but it made me feel worse. 

Eye contact starts to get too hard when my anxiety is bad, no matter who it is. I notice the other persons eyes start to strain as if they are letting me know my eyes are looking anxious and maybe large? Not sure how much of that is in my head, but that's how it seems? And I start to look away.. 

I also can't smile when I am feeling like that. I guess I have a flat look and worried eyes. Sometimes I think my eyes could look scary and big due to the anxiety?

Seeing the neighbor didn't help when feeling like this, I just put my hand up and say hi before going into the house..

I feel people are looking at me in a strange way.

Is this anxiety? Or something more?"
Anxiety,Contamination OCD really really need some advice asap. pls help.,
Anxiety,Something which helped me,"Hi guys, 

I haven’t posted on here much but I’ve been reading a lot. In the last year I have really been struggling with anxiety. Not so much social anxiety, but mostly general life which would make me not want to see family etc because I didn’t want them to judge my lack of progress. Anyway, the thing which helped me get over this was learning to ride a motorcycle. Obviously that’s is inherently a dangerous activity which can be made safer by wearing proper gear and having adequate training. So learning to ride and upskilling has helped to alter my perception of threat to manageable levels. I just wanted to share this in case anyone else was considering it. It’s not a lifelong passion and I only decided to do it about  months ago, but it has an unanticipated benefit of helping to alter my threat perceptions because I have otherwise a fairly sedentary lifestyle. I hope this can help someone."

I'm scared that I contaminated the pickle bottle and now I don't know what to do. I don't want to throw it out but I don't know if I should just ignore it either.

Anxiety,My anxiety can’t handle this Covid and disease-filled world anymore. I can’t keep going on like this and I’ve tried everything,"I’ve struggled with health anxiety long before the pandemic began but, like many people, it’s gotten significantly worse the last few years. I’ll go through periods where I feel normal and less anxious, but the second I get sick I start spiraling and it goes on for months. In the summer of , I had stomach issues that were unrelated to Covid, but given my overall anxiety levels it completely ruined my summer. Then I felt mostly fine until May  when I had my first case of Covid. Although my case was mild, I couldn’t stop thinking about Covid or possible long Covid for months, again ruining my summer and nearly forcing me to quit my job and go into more intensive therapy. Felt like I once again got over the hump, only to get sick again with a cold last week and now likely have Covid again (was directly exposed and started feeling worse after getting over the cold - waiting on test results). 

I don’t think I can handle this roller coaster anymore. I’ve tried everything - therapy, changing medications, meditation, exercise, diet, you name it. I can’t keep flipping between “everything is fine, life is good” and “I’m gonna die or have serious long term health problems” for months at a time. The lack of consistency in my emotions when I’m sick vs. healthy is taking its toll on me and this feels like the last straw. At this point I’m just waiting for this next case of Covid to disable me and give me an excuse to stop working and abandon all of my social responsibilities. It feels inevitable and I feel broken. I don’t know if I can fight this any longer."

Anxiety,Nothings really working,"I’m really tired of how I’ve been feeling.  I’m pretty sure I have seasonal/situational anxiety and depression, not to self-diagnose.

Recently, though, I still feel like shit while I’m there.  Thoughout the day, I’ll have moments of clarity where I feel fine and then out of nowhere its bad again.  I’m starting therapy in a couple of days so hopefully I’ll see some progress and maybe once I get into the rhythm of school and the season changes a bit I’ll feel better but right now I feel so hopeless and I just keep thinking that my whole life is just gonna be sadness and anxiety no matter what I do with my life.

Anxiety,Is it just another bad anxiety conditionning ?,"I have panic attacks and I'm afraid of going crazy. I read a lot about schizophrenia and delusions.

One day, I had a simple coincidence, like thinking about a subject and then seeing it appear in my facebook thread a little later.

At that moment I said to myself: ""Hey, this is weird, what if I'm delusional? I read somewhere that schizophrenics see coincidences and hidden messages... wtf that's it!  I'm becoming delusional??""

Then I had a massive panic attack.

Since then, I notice MUCH MORE coincidences than before and each time I worry and panic a lot. Everyday I anticipate noticing them

I never wanted to be on meds but I feel I’m really getting bad and I have reached out for help multiple times and was always prescribed something but never fell through with taking it but this time I just felt like I’m at rock bottom and I have to do it. My problem is I’m always soooo so anxious over taken meds and go start my lexapro. How will I feel? Will I act different as a mother? And then when I take Ativan for the occasional panic attacks that creep up on me how will I feel then? Can someone leave there experience good or bad on taking either. And how it makes them feel. I just feel alone during this process. My husband is like the most calm least stress person and doesn’t understand mental health even though he tries his best.

Anxiety,Having anxiety attacks for the first time. Feels like I am having Heart Attack. What should I do to cope?,"Two days back, when I was getting out of my car, I felt a bit of pain in my chest and got scared hoping nothing bad happens, Two hours later, I was coding and suddenly the laptop screen became blurry.

I couldn't breathe. My heart was pounding very heavily as it was somewhat audible. I checked my fitbit and my heart beat was about bpm. I have not experienced anything like this before. Got even more scared thinking it might be heart attack. 

After  minutes, my brother took me to hospital and ECG came out with the diagnosis of Sinus Tachycardia. Doctors told me everything was ok considering my age which is  years. Next day I felt a burning sensation in my chest and day after went to doctor. They took a lots of test and everything came out normal.

The doctor gave me a medicine to try for a week which is Petril Beta  (It calms the brain  by decreasing the abnormal and excessive activity of the nerve cells. It  blocks the action of certain chemical messengers on the heart and blood  vessels. This reduces heart rate and blood pressure).

I ate it yesterday and felt relaxed but still today I felt the panic attack.

I am not even sure if it is Panic attack or Heart Attack.

If something like this has happened to some of you, can you please advice me on what should I do to reduce these attacks. And whether these are panic attacks or some other medical issue. 

Please I need help. I think I might not make it to tomorrow.  I am constantly scared of heart attack.

Please give me some suggestions. All advice will be appreciated.

Thanks !"
Anxiety,Anxiety or illness?,"I was doing great for a while but recently ole anxiety has decided to act up and now I can't decipher physical symptoms and actual illness. 

I think it could be anxiety because of situations like the other day where (I've been having a lot of random nosebleeds lately?) I had a nosebleeds and because of a weird feeling in my head I convinced myself it was an aneurism or something and had an exhausting and terrifying panic attack right in my boyfriend arms, which was vaguely humiliating. 

But like my heart has been fluttering, my chest is tight and Ive had a butterfly feeling in my stomach for the past  hours ish and I took a propranolol to see if it would help me finish my food, but now I'm worried I'm masking an actual illness with anxiety/propranolol to dull the symptoms. 

I've had an ECG and depthy blood test recently because of chest pain and weakness, the bloods came back fine and 
I haven't had the ecg results back yet. 

I'll admit I have some health anxiety but my counselling sessions ended literally the day my counsellor discovered my health anxieties (I turned  so was leaving camhs), so I'm not sure whether to keep worrying about like some underlying health issue or just blame anxiety.

Just wondering if anyone's experienced this or has any words of advice"

Right beside the sign was a young guy in his s looked like and he was smoking. We made eye contact immediately after I read the sign and jokingly blurted out ""smoking within  meters"". It was % a joke and it was just an awkward encounter where I had to say something. He said nothing but as I walked away I heard him tell a friend who walked up to him ""I dont give a \\\\ about a sign, I'd smoke you if you weren't with your kid"".

Anxiety,Drove all the way to work today,"Okay so my work is like  minutes away (which I know isn’t that far) but in the last two weeks everything was fine and then boom, my anxiety came back worse than ever. I’m talking panic attack after panic attack. I couldn’t sleep. My mind was racing. So obviously I stayed home the whole time and just tried to meditate and take care of myself. During that time I’ve gotten kind of a fear of driving and being away from home because it’s my safe place. I am taking  weeks off work but I needed to pick up my cheque and I was so anxious and afraid I couldn’t do it. But I decided to try anyways because I don’t want to live in fear. AND I DID IT. I didn’t even have a panic attack!! I was still anxious and jittery but the longer I drove the better it got. I feel so proud of myself. :) I started listening to the DARE audios on their app (with the  week free trial) and it has really helped me put things into perspective!! If you are reading this, YOU CAN DO THIS! Baby steps, but eventually they will pile up! I’m so excited to start to get better, it’s going to be a long and hard journey but I want it so bad and nothing is going to stop me from getting better !!!"

Anxiety,Has anyone here used benzos in a safe and healthy way? And found them helpful?,"I’m aware that benzos are highly addictive. I get it. But since they’re prescribed so often and are “meant” to help - I’m just wondering if anyone feels that way? 

So a little bit of context - I’m a F and I have a diagnosed social anxiety disorder along with PTSD. Have been going for talk therapy (a mix of CBT and DBT) since a few years now. Have never approached a psychiatrist before. 

Recently - my therapist and I spoke about being open to getting some SOS meds. I wanted something for anxiety attacks OR even situations where my social anxiety REALLY acts up to an extent that it affects my career (example. public speaking / giving presentations / sitting for interviews etc). Or just a horrible day where my anxiety is playing up more than usual. Once again, SOS situations. Once in a couple of weeks kind of things. 

I visited a psychiatrist and I have been prescribed a medicine that’s a mix of a benzo with a beta blocker. I’ve been asked to take it about mins before a performance anxiety triggering event. My psychiatrist told me, if used once in a while, these medicines can be wonderful. 

I’ve owned these medicines since a few weeks now and haven’t necessarily been in a situation where my anxiety is absolutely debilitating. But since I’ve been prescribed the meds, I’m open to taking them if I’m in an SOS situation. 

I’m so scared though, because all I seem to read about is how horrible these meds are. Either about how well they work hence making them unbearably addicting irrespective of how careful you are OR about how the rebound anxiety is horrible. 

I’m so curious to hear if anybody here has actually used them in a way that’s been helpful to them."

I've been to every possible doctor(pulmonologist, ENT, allergists) and took several treatments but none of them worked. I did pretty much all lung and throat related investigations.

I'm thinking maybe is just pure phychological. Stress and anxiety cough is real. You see, I have this cough problem since I was  years old. Every year it haunted me but I've always managed to treat it somehow.

And there is one more thing. Every time I hear or read something about lungs or illness related my cough starts getting worse(just like Walter White coughs in Breaking Bad, for example). It's like my brain activates.

Do you have any idea how to treat this or if it's anxiety-stress related?"
Anxiety,I’m having an anxiety relapse.,
Anxiety,I’m too anxious to go outside and it’s bad,"So I’ve been having ear pain for a couple days but the thought of going to the urgent care is so terrifying. I managed to throw out /th of the recycling but that took so much out of me. I looked at the mirror before “leaving” and I just hated everything about myself and now i’m sitting on the couch, technically ready to go and I just wanna cry. I want to disappear. I hate myself for not going to the doctor when I very much need to. I feel myself spiraling and Im trying everything not to cry.  

For the past  days, I haven’t been able to even leave my apartment. Got my groceries delivered, go take out food, living in mess because I need to throw things out but even stepping outside my apartment is a challenge. To get out of bed or to stop crying I would smoke alittle bit of weed and be able to do stuff like shower or do dishes. I can’t get high before a doctors visit. What if they know? What if they judge? I just can’t do it but I can’t do anything. I’m frozen in fear - of what? I DONT FUCKING KNOW. 

I think I need to seek professional help but the last time I brought this up to a doctor, she straight up told me it was a mindset and that I’m addicted to my phone and that’s why I’m scared to go to my local CVS to pick up a fucking prescription (not for anxiety). So my fear is I’ll tell another doctor and they’ll tell me the same thing and I’ll wanna  myself even more."

Anxiety,Have you guys used an sssri along with exposure therapy to fix your anxiety?,I have terrible anxiety when it comes to social situations. I have read that an SSRI combined with therapy can help because after a certain time SSRIs promote neuroplasticity so you change your brain. Am thinking of starting off on an SSRI combined with therapy putting myself in the situations while on it. I am also thinking of whenever going out to maybe taking a benzo when I get into those scenarios that make me extremely anxious so with the SSRI neuroplasticity and the benzo getting rid of the anxiety I can train my brain to not get anxious in those situations. Have any of you guys here done that. Still have to talk it over with my doctor.

Anxiety,I’m constantly worried about getting in trouble or fired from work.,"So I will keep some things vague, but I’m in an entry level job in my field getting paid a salary. Been here about half a year now and am still worried about getting in trouble and possibly fired. Just a short while ago I was given a written warning about a mistake I made, it was a simple mistake and I know where I went wrong which is good. Today I’ve made another mistake though which led to someone not being able to work for multiple hours. Again it was a simple mistake, and not one I’ve made before but I’m still worried that I’m getting in trouble for all these things and will just be fired because it seems I’m unable to do my job without making these mistakes now and then."

Anxiety,High Heart Rate for Days,"So, I’ve had my anxiety diagnosis for a while, and the last  months or so I’ve had times of really high resting heart rates. (My baseline is between -, and we’re talking like + for days on end). I’m a  year man and mostly healthy. 
I’ve gone to cardiologists and my heart is completely healthy and they’ve all said it’s anxiety based and my heart isn’t taking damaging from the fast beating. 
However, it sucks. Like I’ll be chilling reading and all of a sudden I’m my chest hurts and my heart rate spikes (highest spike every was  for a few minutes). Usually I also feel anxious but I’m able to ground myself and not get a panic attack. Still, it’s wildly uncomfortable to wake up and say “damn, so looks like my heart is gonna be beating super fast for a few days). 
I’m on anxiety and depression medications (Lexapro and Lamictal), but ever time I’ve tried to taper off, my heart rate spikes because the medication keeps my anxiety down. 

Anyone have a similar situation or thoughts? This is totally managable but not sustainable… as in, I don’t need an immediate solution, but a solution to work to is great! 
Thanks in advance"

Anxiety,Rumination,
Anxiety,I wish to step outside of my mind,"As long as I can remember, I've lived in my mind.

I can remember my internal monologue controlling my feelings as young as five years old. I'm mid-forties now and I feel I've almost entirely disappeared inside my brain.

I ruminate constantly, I over-obsess about every detail. My brain often asks me the same questions over and over almost forcing me into daydream mode. I thought this was a coping mechanism for stress, but I've just had a few weeks off, I've had a lot of time to myself and my brain still seems to ask the same questions:

""Am I happy"" ""What do I want now"" ""If I had unlimited funds, what would I do"" ""If you could do anything what would you do"" ""What do you want to be"" ""I'm sad and frustrated, what am I going to do about it"".

Sometimes I'll arrive at work and realize I daydreamed the entire commute. Sometimes I'll go for a walk and I realize I didn't see or hear anything. Everything was inside my head. I have elaborate scenarios planned out. I've written entire books based on my brain movies, but more often than not, it's the same repeating garbage.

At Christmas, everyone is sitting around opening presents and having a great time and I'm hyper analyzing everyone's expressions, the day, what I need to do, what I wished the day were. Before I know it I've missed the moment because I was too busy analyzing everything. 

Now. The answer is to be more mindful. I go for walks and I force my brain not to think. But the whole time I'm thinking about not thinking.

I try to smell, touch, breathe and focus on breathing, but all of this is like bending steel. I can't seem to undo the life long patterns in my brain.

I take time to meditate nearly every day (at least  mins), and during that time my brain is like trying to keep helium balloons under a blanket, they just keep popping up. I've looked into CBT and ACT, I accept the thoughts, I thank my brain for them, but they don't stop.

Now this sounds like classic mindfulness, but I've been trying to meditate and be mindful for YEARS now. I've read various books like the happiness trap and I cannot defuse these thoughts. I realize they're just thoughts, not facts, yet my brain just rushes to find something, anything to hold onto.

I have made some progress. I was able to train my brain away and remove suicidal ideation from the constant questions mentioned above. I used to constantly say to myself I want to die. I corrected myself over years to say, I want things to change, then forced myself to be grateful instead, but this feels more like I'm steering the rocket. I want the rocket to stop.

I often ask my wife what she's thinking and usually it's nothing or very little. I wish this to be me so much. I'm just always going.

Anyone have any tips on how to stop?"
Anxiety,I feel hopeless and so tired,"my anxiety is getting really bad. the past  months have been awful but lately it’s getting even worse. I have agoraphobia and can’t do anything anymore. I keep having random panic/ anxiety attacks. I’m having really bad death anxiety. it’s all I think about constantly. the same thoughts circling in my head. every second of every day it’s all I think about. I cant take it anymore. even my dreams are giving me anxiety. when I wake up I can remember my dreams almost like they were real( I know they aren’t) but they feel so real. the past couple of days i’ve woken up with my chest feeling heavy and almost feeling like i’m suffocating. my body feels so tired from the physical symptoms. the nausea, tiredness, lightheadedness, chest pain/burning, heart racing, feeling shaky/weak, and so many more. i’ve also had a constant feeling like nothing is real. i feel really disconnected from my body. I just feel like everything is off. every day feels the exact same. I feel like time is flying by and it feels like my life is over. i’m stuck in a sick cycle of anxiety that I can’t get out of. i’m so worn out. I feel like nothing matters anymore. i don’t want to be this way. i want to feel like me again. this is so awful and scary."
Anxiety,Help?,"I was officially diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder) a few years ago. Something that's been catching up with me is my teeth and jaw health. Apparently I super clench my jaw when I'm stressed during the day.

Is there anything I can use to put between my teeth DURING THE DAY to help take some of the stress off of my jaw/teeth? I used to bite my tongue but now it's super clenching my teeth. I can't afford to do something like Botox in the muscle to see if that'd help."

Anxiety,Need advice on what to do. (health scare/anxiety.),"I’ve had severe anxiety since I was  I’m  now. My anxiety is especially bad when it comes to my health but for the past month I’ve been panicking everyday. In spring  I went to the eye doctor with my dad and my sister.(For a back story the last time I went before  was  and in  I went with my sister and my mom) in  my sister got diagnosed with glaucoma. When we went again in  the eye doctor said that diagnosis was incorrect but that’s all I remembered. Lately I’ve been getting terrible pain in my eyes and sometimes seeing the color white with a yellow tint. I was talking about it and my sister told me when we went to the eye doctor in  they said that they accidentally switched our diagnosis and I actually had glaucoma and I would lose my vision. I immediately got anxiety and felt like I was gonna throw up. I don’t remember that happening. What would they even tell me if I did have glaucoma?!? I asked my dad and he said he doesn’t remember them saying that. I asked my mom and she told me to call the office and ask for my medical history. It’s been one month and I haven’t called. I cry everyday and go in to full panic attacks where I feel like I’m gonna to have a heart attack thinking about it. I don’t wanna know if I do have it. I know this sounds so dramatic and horrible but I’d rather unalive then live with a fatal eye disease (not literally). Should I call the office? If I called and it was bad news I wouldn’t know how to go on knowing I’m going blind. For the past few years life has been very rough, I’ve been through a lot. If I found out I was going blind that would actually be the straw that broke the camels back."
Anxiety,Living next to a construction site :(,
Anxiety,Anxiety has been through the roof and nothing helps!,"Idk what has been going on with my body recently but I've been experiencing shortness of breathe, low energy, and my body feels cold. I thought it was the alcohol withdrawl at first. I drank at least a pint of  proof liquor about  times per week for the last - months but haven't drank since /. I was also taking about  mg Ativan or sometimes Xanax at night to aid in the alcohol withdrawl but that was only for a few months and haven't taken any in  weeks. I have had blood work done and a chest ct scan and everything came back normal. What's really frustrating is everything that used to work before when these symptoms would hit me no longer work. Along with being alcohol free, I have changed my diet and started drinking a lot more water. I also limited my caffeine intake. I even started exercising more which helped before but now makes me feel worse  minutes or so after. Even CBD that always used to help me before no longer works! Deep breathing exercises don't work either. Is there something more serious going on? What other medical tests/procedures should I do to rule out other possibilities?"

Anxiety,I had a panic attack during sx,
Anxiety,I am in a panic/ anxiety cycle that I can not get out of,"I am a  year old female and have had pretty troubling anxiety from very young, I just didn’t realize because nothing brought it to my direct attention until October of . I had a random panic attack one day in the car with my dad. I couldn’t breathe, heart rate at  and my skin felt tingly like it was detaching from my body. My main symptom is throwing up or dry heaving during a panic/ anxiety attack.

I have had  major panic attacks since and get stuck in these cycles of remembering how I felt and being so scared of having another one it completely consumes my thoughts and i give myself another attack. They are random and out of nowhere, I do not know how to control my subconscious thoughts and I am literally terrified of myself. Extreme debilitating anxiety is left over for - days.

I am now starting to wonder if my anxiety is gut related due to the randomness of attacks, my chronic stomach issues and throwing up every time I have an attack. Should I try holistic approaches before medication? I know the answer is yes, but I don’t know how much longer, mentally, I can handle these extreme, multiple day attacks."

Anxiety,mg of lexapro and mg of Wellbutrin and serotonin syndrome,
Anxiety,Globus sensation only on the right side of my throat,"I (F) have been suffering from globus sensation (the feeling of something stuck in my throat) for . years. It began one month after a neck injury that caused me a lot of anxiety because it was not healing. I have a long history of anxiety / depression / eating disorder prior to this. 

I was convinced my globus was not anxiety-related / psychological because it is  constant (unless I’m actively eating or drinking) and I hear a click sound when I swallow. However, after numerous GI tests, X-rays, ultrasounds that found nothing wrong, I’m starting to accept that my globus is likely caused by anxiety. I’m stuck in the vicious cycle of constantly “checking in” to see if it’s still there and perpetuating it. 

The one thing I’m held up on is that my globus sensation is only on the right side of my throat. 

Is that common in globus or could it imply something is physically wrong?"

I have OCD as well. and I obsess over a lot of things related to my upbringing. I want to stop suffering with my broken brain. It has caused me to have low self esteem as a woman, believing I can't do anything because of my gender.

I started therapy a little less than a year ago and for awhile my therapist and I agreed I didn’t need meds at the time because I had been feeling better and using the tools we were discussing in therapy. But then a few months ago I had some triggers that really set me back and I just haven’t been doing well, so my therapist is on me about trying out meds.

i am scared shitless. this is the worst my anxiety has been since my last episode. i have no appetite, i’m vomiting, i’m having panic attacks, and i cry constantly. i know being anxious about moving out is a normal reaction, but this is a little much.

Anxiety,Panic attack while sleeping?,"Somethign weird happened to me a couple nights ago and I'd love to hear an opinion. I don't remember most of what happened, for the most part this is retelling what my SO told me the next morning.

Basically, I woke them up by asking them some nonsense question over and over again, getting more and more anxious about the fact that they don't seem to understand me. It took them quite some effort to calm me back down and get me back to sleep. They talked to me and cuddled with me and told me it will be okay, which I'm very grateful for, and apparently I had more or less clear conversation with them once I started to calm down.

I remember none of this, except that I talked to them and the feeling of intense dread. 

As far as I'm aware, I don't have any anxiety disorders and have never had panic attacks before that. I have BPD though, if thats relevant.

Any ideas what happened?"

My partner has a driving test coming soon. This has me incredibly scared. Because with her work. She is just in an office space for most of the day. On the way there and back or during lunch. She would call me to keep me company as I do her. So I don't get scared she's had a car accident or something worse.   


I hope people here can understand that. This test scares me because I am not sure how long it will take and she won't be able to update me obviously as she is working with an instructor. I am trying to figure out ways to make this less scary for me because it is currently making me very anxious.   


Would someone like myself be able to attend as a passenger for this? It might be something specific to certain places doing these things. I hope anyone can help with any sort of advice. Thank you."

Every time I eat, no matter what it is, I get stomach aches/nasuea. When I am hungry, I don't feel like eating anymore. Nor do I get hungry as much. I recognize these stomach aches to be my anxiety stomach aches, which is one of the common symptoms I get from anxiety. I also have been having a particularly horrid mental health rutt.

Anxiety,Dr Rossi says anxiety isn't independant disorder?,"So there's this channel on youtube called: Shrinks in sneakers. This guy is a psychiatrist and talks about various topics such as meds and mental disorders.

What caught my attention is this video: 

Here he says that GAD hasn't undergone adequate scientific research to call it independent disorder and that there's always a ""cause"" for anxiety (:).

I myself suffer from anxiety and sometimes I feel it without any real cause. I just feel the cloud of worry and that something bad might happen.

However, this doc says that GAD itself might not be present as standalone condition and that there's always a cause (outside factors).

This kind of irritates me, since it runs contrary to my experience.

What do psychiatrists on this subreddit think about his statement?"

Sometimes I can't sleep while I think about it.

How is this possible? It's like I was turning  yesterday, but now  years have passed just like that. I was young and could've become anything I wanted, now I'm old, a looser and a huge embarassment for my parents. Yet even back then the idea of time passing kept me awake at night. I remember loosing my sleep at the thought of turning . Now I'm . I just wish I couldbe normal"
Anxiety,Has anyone with anxiety been able to divorce yourself from social media?,"Hi. I'm a really anxious person, have been all my life, just diagnosed with both GAD and panic disorders. Explains a lot!

Social media used to assuage my anxiety by convincing me that I was still relevant and popular, but as I've gotten older it's just been really bothersome. I posted something today and my neighbor yelled at me about it (and she had a point) and I not only started panicking for an hour straight but I cleaned my garage so I could move my car in there so I wouldn't have to see her when leaving the house. I think I need help. I still keep looking at it! The dopamine! The serotonin! AAAHHHH.

Is there anything you fellow anxiety folk do to stay away from social media? Give your phone to a loved one? Just get rid of your accounts entirely? How do you do it? I am ready to burn it all down but I don't know if I have the guts!"

Anxiety,Anxiety Disorder / Caffeine?,"Hi Everyone, 

First post, could do with some help! 

Many months ago I suffered my first anxiety attack. Ever since it’s been a battle, figuring out triggers every day etc. 

Long story short, caffeine is a major trigger for me! 

I love my energy drinks &amp; coffees so it’s a big problem for me to think I can never have caffeine again. 

Does anyone know how to solve this? Or any solutions? I understand energy drinks are bad, but I love a red bull from time to time!.. I’ve heard L-Theanine is meant to help? Not sure! 

Much appreciated"

Anxiety,I can’t go anywhere without anyone without being the one behind the steering wheel.,
Anxiety,I feel so incredibly lost. Am I feeling alone with this?,
Anxiety,I cant go anywhere without being the one behind the steering wheel.,"I apologize if this is not the right place to post this, but I have a feeling that it has to do with anxiety and it helps to write things out and share it.

I have a really hard time going places without being the one that drives. I hate the road. I feel as though it’s the most dangerous place that everyone goes every day. When I’m not driving, I get carsick to the point of vomiting. I get irritated and unable to enjoy the time that I have in the car with my friends or family. I just have a hard time with any driver other than me. I don’t like my life being in someone else’s hands. And even if it’s my best friend, who I know is a fantastic driver, I don’t like it. Because they change lanes too hard, or they do something small that I personally wouldn’t do. A lot of it is car sickness and distrust, but a lot of it is just irritation in general.

It’s not just being in the car though. The biggest reason I have to drive every time is because if I don’t, I can’t leave if something bad happens. If I feel sick, I can’t just make an excuse to leave and go hop in my car. If I’m uncomfortable in any way, I have to get the permission of the driver to take me home. I also find peace in my car. My car is a safe space for me, like a bed or a bedroom or a tent. Anywhere I go, no matter what happens, I can check out and just go sit in my car. With my music, in my seat, with my ac set to my preference. 

The reason I wanted to post this is because I recently went on a road trip with my family and it significantly impacted my time on the trip. Everything I described above is pretty much how I felt, and this is nowhere near the first time this has happened. As a college student, I won’t go out drinking with my friends either, because I know I won’t be able to drive home. It’s also not great for me financially to drive myself absolutely everywhere, which is what I do. 

I would love to know if anyone else has experienced this, or anything similar, and learn how I can help ease my anxiety a little bit with driving."

On MG of Lexapro and  of Buspar. (OCD folks get higher doses). Went to work Wednesday (th), was a very average day nothing out of the ordinary. Neither was the evening I just colored on my iPad ( year old child). I then woke up a  am feeling very uncomfortable and anxious, cold and hot spots, racing thoughts etc... since then my anxiety and intrusive thoughts have heavily spiked. I just can't get comfortable physically or in my mind. I've tried some medication and running on the treadmill. Unfortunately with mental health the work you put in can take a while to pay dividends. I had a much worse episode a year ago that landed me in the psych ward. I did get diagnosed with OCD at that time. They now have me taking Klono and Seroquel in low doses twice a day to see if it gets me through. I was able to get into my therapist this week thankfully and hopefully he's got some pointers. No need to response I'm just venting and frustrated I was doing so well then it all changed over night."
Anxiety,Clawing my neck bloody,"TW: accidental self harm, physical abuse

What’s happening to me? 
I used to suffer from really bad anxiety and I have PTSD. Gotten it pretty under control but lately a couple things have pushed me over the edge (I had some issues with someone I really care about it it was mostly out of my control so I didn’t know how to handle it. Like I literally think I had a bit of a mental breakdown the first/worst time it happened and it’s made me a nervous wreck since) 
The “attack” basically consists of maybe a bit of crying/frustration, I am very in control of my words and actions &amp; I don’t lash out at others but for some reason I get really frantic and it’s a bit hard to breathe, I can’t have anything near my neck and I yank at my shirt collars so during these two recent attacks I accidentally ripped two necklaces off of me and I have long scratches from my nails on my collarbone that bled. I can’t even control it or really understand what happened?
I never wore necklaces until this year because I couldn’t have anything around my neck because my brother used to strangle me when I was younger (I’m in my mid s now). Do you think this clawing at my neck area is my anxiety? Or PTSD from being choked a lot during conflicts with my brother when I was a kid/teen? I’m not looking for a diagnosis as I already have these, just looking for insight to help me understand where this specific issue is coming from or any leads on what else I can look into? I need to learn how to stop it before it gets worse.
I also had a PTSD attack the other month (thought this person was trying to kill me even though they definitely weren’t) which I don’t know if that has ever happened or at least not in years so I don’t really know what’s happening to me or why"

Then again I am brushing pretty hard, but it bled even when I was brushing softly…maybe it’s cause it’s an electric toothbrush. I become worried that I have leukemia.

Anxiety,What to do when therapy isn’t for you?,"I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for about  years now. During that time I’ve tried all types of therapy including DBT, Mindfulness, Talk, and Hypnosis. When I say try I really gave my best effort to be honest and open and truly give them a fair shot (at least  years spent trying each method). I’ve also tried working with different therapists and counselors. Unfortunately I’ve grown so discouraged with therapy that I can’t bring myself to do it anymore and it’s become a new trigger for me. 

My question is has anyone else experienced this? I feel like I’m just missing something because I’ve only heard great stories about people’s experiences with therapy. 
For those that might have experienced this, what have you done instead to work through anxiety and/or depression? I do have a psychiatrist that solely focuses on my anxiety medication (Paxil). But I don’t want to just rely on a medication. I want to proactively work on myself."

Anxiety,Is this normal?,
Anxiety,Anxiety shaking (M),"For the past few days I've been having really bad anxiety. I can't do anything without it stressing me out and giving me a knot in my chest. Or I'll randomly think of something I did in the past and I'll do fast jerking motions with my body to make myself feel better. I've been door dashing beer and food because I'm scared to show my face in a grocery store.

This is definitely not the first time this has happened. I think I have a lot of childhood trauma from being molested and watching my manic mom attempt suicide. I think I need to get some professional help. I'm talking to a therapist right now and I'm going to start with hypnotherapy since it sounds relaxing and will help me focus. Luckily I have good insurance through my union. My union likely wants me to get on another ship soon but I need to take care of this.

I think I've been depressed or something for most of my life. It was getting better when I was with my ex but I'd still have social anxiety and couldn't handle myself in a lot of social interactions especially around family. I cheated on her with my first love and many others.

On top of that my first love died about  years ago and I've been having an extremely hard time since then. I have low energy and I don't feel passionate or motivated by anything.

I've pushed almost all of my friends and family away for no other reason other than I hate myself and I can't face reality.

I need to be accountable for my actions but I also need help from a professional. I don't want any medication. My mom has been on meds since before I was born and she's been in and out of mental hospitals. I forget what drug it was but she was prescribed something, I think in the early s, that gave her permanent damage. She even had electric shock therapy. 

Now I even feel anxious from turning down work and disappointing my dispatcher. But if they contact me maybe I should just explain to them that I need to take care of myself without disclosing my mental health.

I feel a little better after writing this. Thank you"

I wish I could learn how to make it stop. Yes, I take meds for it."
Anxiety,Bad Psychiatry Experiences?,"I want to just create a safe space for a second to rant about bad experiences with a psychiatrist.

I started with a psych CNP back in . We meet over video usually once a month or every  months depending on medication changes. I was doing really well with her— she had me on zoloft and xanax for panic attacks. My anxiety was being pretty well managed.

Starting in , she began training students and without my consent, she had me meet with her students. Throughout , I think I only met with her once or twice. I totally understand that students need people to train on, but I don’t want every visit to be with a student. In November, I was diagnosed with acute hypercalcemia and started to experience depression and fatigue (something I’d never experienced before). The beginning of my session with my CNP, she started off by getting my entire medical history wrong. I mean she doesn’t need to know it by memory, but can she at least read my chart? She then proceeded to put me on Wellbutrin, told me no information on it, and didn’t let me ask questions. I started taking the Wellbutrin, but began to feel severely worse anxiety.

In December, I was ready to meet with her and tell her all the issues I was having with the meds. I was greeted by a man who never introduced himself (I can only assume he was a student?) and he asked me how the meds were going. I told him I was having daily panic attacks and could barely leave the house. He proceeded to ask what I do for the panic attacks and I answered that I’ve been practicing breathing techniques and other deescalation techniques I learned in therapy. He told me I should be either going to the hospital and taking xanax for every panic attack. I responded by saying that sounds extremely unhealthy and I will be continuing what I’ve learned in therapy. He then asked if that was my first panic attack. It was then that I realized he never read my damn chart. I was horrified. I knew that I couldn’t let this man touch my medications.

I told him the Wellbutrin isn’t working well for me and it’s made me feel terrible. He said that we should probably just up the Wellbutrin. I said that sounds like a not great solution since I told you it makes it worse and upping it wouldn’t make sense. He asked if I want him to either up the Wellbutrin or the Zoloft. At that point I told him neither since I felt very uncomfortable with the situation. He asked about the Xanax and I said that I’m feeling uneasy because my tolerance has increases from . mg to  mg. . mg used to knock me out and now  mg makes me feel just kinda calm. I expressed how this is concerning for addiction. His response was that  mg is a safe dose and he completely dismissed my concerns. I said it’s not the dosage I’m scared of, but the extreme tolerance. He told me not to worry.

Long story short, I have an appointment tomorrow with a new psychiatrist, but does anyone have these issues too?"

However now I'm filling out an application for an academic program and when it asks me if I self identify as a person with a disability I don't know what to say. 

Has anyone else recently got their condition labelled as a disability? How did you change your mindset to acknowledge that this is something you deal with on a daily basis and it is a disability? I guess I'm having trouble validating my own experiences because I keep on thinking about how there's probably people out there that have to deal with much worse and don't have this affordance like I do."

Anxiety,Why am I so anxious?,
Anxiety,Health Anxiety Taking its Toll,"I've been living with anxiety for a while, in the past  years it has gotten more aggressive and turned into frequent panic attacks and excessive worrying, I never sought therapy because I grew up always handling things myself and tbh I had pretty good control over it. I was always able to calm myself down, practiced breathing techniques, my panic would last maybe at most two minutes tops. I miss those days, I didn't know how good I had it. 

Since November my health anxiety has gotten progressively worse,  it started out with my me having extreme neck, jaw and head pain - at one point it was very hard for me to even chew, my jaw seemed so tight (this only happened once) since then its been chest pain, erratic heart beats, migraines that last forever, shortness of breath, pain in neck and shoulder. Always one symptom out another one in. A non stop cycle for now almost two months straight. In two months i've been to the ER  times, two chest CT scans , one of my head, a visit to my reg doctor, a cardiologist.  At one point my panic attacks from my response to this health worry got so bad that it legit felt like I was about to lose control over my sanity and made me have several episodes of (actually diagnosed) de-realization. Which basically feels like I'm living in a dream state for an undetermined amount of time. sometimes these episodes can last  minutes, sometimes it can last hours. 

   For the past two months I've honestly been waiting to die. I just keep expecting it, I keep expecting to have a heart attack or a stroke or a seizure. Yesterday I took a nap and had a dream of me on the train, I felt so scared and alone and I was clutching my mothers arm, I couldn't see her face, and she didn't speak. But I cried as I clung onto her. (Im legit , I'm not even close with my mother, I've never dreamt something like this) and then I was on the train platform by myself asking some figure if I was dead the figure answered I was and told me to see if I could wake my self up, I tried but couldn't and then suddenly I was in my room, in my bed, in the dark, and I sat up and my heart was racing so fast in my chest and just getting faster and I tried to get off my bed but my vision was fading and it felt like my heart might explode and then I actually woke up, for real and I sat in bed and cried, because this sickness has worked its way into my subconscious, like a spider sinking its fangs, its poison seeping deeper into my psyche. 

It's crazy to think the guy (myself) who randomly did acid in a bar years ago is now living this life where he's afraid of everything. My friends used to jokingly say I was the chosen one, I don't really know why maybe  because I had been through a lot  (and I mean that) and I always got through, always stayed positive but this thing is killing me. Its honestly eating away at me. I don't know why I'm writing this but i've always thought it was easier to reveal the truth to a stranger(s) I want to be free of this curse so badly. I want to live without fear, and walk in the sun truly feeling chosen again."

Anxiety,Starting my first 'real' job but anticipatory anxiety is HORRIBLE,"I start my first real job, in a real office, in about three weeks. The anticipatory anxiety (feels more like dread tbh) has already started and it's making it really hard to enjoy my last few weeks of laziness and freedom. I jump when my phone buzzes and I dread checking my email because I don't want to have to deal with new employee forms and crap. The anxiety/dread/doom is gnawing at me constantly through the day and I wish it would leave me alone.

How do you deal with anticipatory anxiety/dread? What works for you? I'm going to try to keep up with my journal and start meditating again. That's my only plan so far but I feel like I need something a little more concrete, like something to say, do, or think about when the dread hits full force."

Extreme anxiety for half the day feeling like I was going to pass out, throw up and just extremely tense. Flashes of panic.

I couldn’t stop crying and my breathing was extremely rapid and i felt like i was out of breath. It’s also gotten to a point where i don’t even want to see pictures or photos of other people. My insecurity has never been this bad before and I’ve gotten extremely confident in who i am and how i look these past few years. 

I went through a nasty friendship breakup and now it’s got me questioning so many things, feeling less than, and i haven’t been taking good care of myself.

Anxiety,Overcoming Health Anxiety,"I’m wondering if there is anybody out there that has overcome health anxiety or that has insights into health anxiety that might be able to offer so insight…

Specifically, I’m struggling with anxiety about my health as opposed to psychosomatic symptoms or anxiety about undiagnosed illness. I don’t know if that’s an important distinction to make. 

I also am a little worried to trigger anybody, so please, if you find yourself easily triggered you might just want to skip this post.

I’ve been unwell for a long time. In addition to several mental healthy disorders, I’ve been battling CFS and POTS, or at least that’s the conclusion my docs have arrived at. And those are both difficult diagnoses because they are basically arrived at once nothing else can be found (CFS) and meaningful treatment isn’t really available.

As they have been worsening, I can’t help but think something worse is at play, but I feel like I’ve reached the end of the line in terms of tests, specialists, etc. 

What’s worse, especially of late, is that I genuinely think/feel as though I’m dying. Not in a hyperbolic way, but genuinely. Which has provoked all these thoughts about mortality and such, and I’ve arrived at the conclusion that I’m not ready to die; I’m AFRAID to die. And so I’ve resolved to try to do more with my time, nothing excessive at all, but try to write more or see the movies I’ve always been putting off, but I’ve no energy for anything. 

I’m living in fear while also suffering from these illnesses. And I’m struggling. 

I don’t know if this is allowed (I really hope it is), but if there is anyone out there that feels comfortable DM’ing me so that I can actually engage in a conversation and talk through some of this, I would really appreciate it. I know that’s what therapy is for, but never have much luck with therapy.

Thanks I’m advance. Much love."

I couldn’t tell you why or when it started, but it has made my life much harder to live than necessary and nothing has changed in the almost two decades I’ve been consciously aware of it. It’s usually small things that set it off for me though, for example I wasn’t able to walk into a store by myself until I was  and to this day I still basically panic when I do. Phone calls are also just dreadful, even thinking about dialing a number and calling makes my heart race so I simply avoid it at all costs unless it’s absolutely necessary. I’ve missed out on a lot of really great opportunities in my life due to my anxiety as well, the biggest being my chance at completing college. I was enrolled to a prestigious university in my state with a full ride due to my grades and other accomplishments in Highschool, but I was so afraid of having to not only meet new people in my classes but just walking on campus and feeing the eyes of literally hundreds of people on me that I simply didn’t go to class. Ive never been fortunate enough to afford a therapist, and my family doesn’t really take it seriously enough to support me beyond saying “you need to get over it” or “it’s not that big of a deal you’ll be okay”. I’d say I’m blowing it out of proportion but I’ve had my fair share of severe panic attacks to know better. I’m very unsure of how to effectively deal with my anxiety, it’s been something that has honestly isolated me from family and friends to a point where I’ve dealt with it on my own.

Ive been struggling with sleep for a few years now but it's recently gotten worse in the last few months. 

I struggle to get to sleep in the first place, no matter how tired I am. Tossing and turning, making up unwanted scenarios in my head that will eventually upset me. blah blah blah.

But the main thing I'm concerned about is the fact that my body automatically wakes up like an hour or  before my alarm is set. I don't fully wake up, but I'm consious of time passing. I think this is my body's way of combatting alarm anxiety but it leads to restless nights and exhaustion in the mornings.

How do I combat this?

Anxiety,Dentist Anxiety about Wisdom Teeth,"I have to get my wisdom teeth removed soon. I already cancelled one appointment because of my anxiety, and while I DO want to stop having wisdom teeth pain, at the same time I really don’t want them out. There’s a few reasons I’m so nervous about it. One of them is that it kind of bothers me, the idea that a part of my body that’s been in my gums my whole life is being taken out of my body. Another reason is that I get really nervous in medical settings and situations where I feel like I can’t escape (fight or flight feelings). I need some advice so I can get a new perspective on this. I really want to face my fears, but I’m genuinely terrified."
Anxiety,"My Intrusive thoughts have been triggered, I feel like I shouldn’t be so easily triggered by things that haven’t happened to me. Is this something other people experienced today or in general?","I have been successfully on an SSRI for many many years, but we all know there’s still triggers that still cause intrusive thoughts to linger, even when the medication helps keep most of this at bay. 

I feel silly if I’m watching something, or reading something that’s even fiction and get triggered. But this trigger is not fiction today. 
I was finally joining my husband to watch the Buffalo Bills game for this Monday night game against Cincinnati; I came in while paramedics were already on the field. What happened/is happening to Damar Hamlin is obviously not happening to me, but these things greatly influence my anxiety &amp; intrusive thinking around death and dying, or near death. This is particularly a struggle for me related to premature death of someone I love or for myself. This horrible accident triggers my thoughts specifically about how we don’t know what’s going to happen to us or our loved ones in ,  minute, etc. This terrifies me, and these situations like the Bills game remind me of the fear and lack of control I have in the immediate future, and longer term. 

I even feel guilty sometimes that people are going through horrible things at the same time that I’m enjoying myself, such as the mass shooting at one of our Buffalo grocery stores, while at that time I was on the the other side of town in a store completely oblivious to what was happening right then only  minutes away from me. It just terrifies me that you don’t know when something will happen, when time will run out. But then I feel silly being triggered by what happened during the Bills game, or other things like that that don’t directly influence my life. 

Note: I honestly think there was a possible unknown medical issue that was instigated by a routine tackle. But am I the only one that gets triggered by these things because they remind us of the fear that something could happen at any moment? I just don’t understand why these thing influence me so much."
Anxiety,Anxiety is causing me to impulsively delete socials,"So I've spent most this year being more active on socials. I (M) recently got out of a relationship with my ex (M) and there's this Pinterest account I want to remove because I messaged him on it.

 With this very specific Pinterest account though, although know I think about it I could just restart but idk it's confusing

Sorry if this makes no sense but is there a better way I could wrap my head around it? Convince myself it's not worth deleting my account over?

Keep in mind these convos weren't easy and he didn't/doesn't keep up with my high want for him to block me so now I'm more worried. Idk but I really don't want to remove this account."

Taking flights, buses, taxis, waiting in buildings where I can’t see the restrooms, all give me an irrepressible anxiety.

It has stopped me from being able to travel to lectures at uni, go to work and even meet friends in the past. It’s not something that is prominent every day and some days are easier than others, especially when I’m in familiar settings.

I’m going to take a train to Berlin that takes  hours which kind of freaks me out, then I’m even sleeping in a hostel dorm for four nights. I have lovely support back home so whenever it’s too much I can just travel back. That thought is already comforting. However, the trip is in a month and now I can hardly sleep.

Hoping someone might have some advice on moving forward.

I don't have a PCP and figured I should start with them before going and looking for a therapist. So should I schedule a physical to check for any other issues and do they ask mental health questions that I'd be able to get advice and therapy referrals? Do I need just a general appointment instead for mental health issues? Or should I skip PCP entirely and just start finding a therapist?

If I bring up suicidal thoughts would they put me on a psychiatric hold? I'm not planning anything and confident I wouldn't ever do anything. Just do have thoughts of wanting to die and do sometimes daydream about doing something.

Any advice or resources would be appreciated. I'm kinda stupid so maybe this stuff is obvious or easy to find. Just thinking about getting help I just dont know what I'm doing and don't know who I can ask so hoping there a guide out there so simple even I can follow it or something."

Anxiety,How to fight depression and anxiety,
Anxiety,Is that a sign of schizophrenia?,"First I have to say that I am in contact with my GP but I would like to take the opportunity and ask a question here. :)

I've  had some anxiety issues for  years (I'm  now). I managed to overcome  them with meditation and some life changes. I've always been a bit  anxious, but as my GP told me, it was pretty normal and I shouldn't  worry. Three months ago my girlfriend and I broke up and a lot of things  have changed. I've been having trouble falling asleep for - months  now. I always need  to . hours to fall asleep. I've found that I fall  asleep faster when I'm ""busy"" with nice things or when I'm solving  problems in my mind. That worked fine for me.

Now  to my ""real"" problem: Two to three weeks ago I was driving my car and  an ambulance drove by with sirens. Despite the ambulance was  or   minutes away already, I thought I could still hear the sirens. It  stopped after I started another task in my mind. That felt really weird!

I  started thinking about this situation and became anxious (I have to say  I've had health anxiety for  years). Then, two weeks ago I was reading  a book and I got really tired. Then I decided to take a nap on the  couch. After falling asleep (rather quickly), I  ""heard"" what was like a  jumble of noises and immediately woke up. It sounded like voices in a  very busy restaurant. When I woke up the noise was gone immediately.

During  the following night I tried to fall asleep and suddenly my thoughts  started spinning. It felt like in the beginning of my anxiety disorder.  Soon thoughts went south and I envisioned a smiling face (I did this by  myself and once I started to accept the panic and started meditating  everything was back to normal).

As  I am a very anxious person, I went straight to my family doctor and  told him my story. I also told him I was a little scared it might be  schizophrenia. He told me it was my nerves and not to worry. I tried to  forget it but last night brought my fear back.

I  went to bed very early because I felt anxious throughout the day. I  closed my eyes and did a breathing meditation. I got sleepy and started  some ""tasks"" in my mind and I thought about a nice girl I just met. Then  my thoughts started spinning in my head (nothing bad! Just   thoughts). I was able to stop them, but as soon as I got ""unconscious""  they started again. In this stadium, I can think things that other  people have said in their own voice (I can do that when I'm really  tired. I've been able to for a long time). Somehow this fact made me  even more restless... Finally I fell asleep and woke up well rested this  morning.

I have no symptoms  during the day (only the sirene-thing some time ago). I'm a little  anxious, which leads to a certain lack of motivation.

Somehow  I'm getting more and more anxious and I wanted to ask you ""anxiety experienced""  people whether I should go to my GP again, or just be patient and wait  until my nerves relax. I am a experienced ""health anxiety veteran"" and  want to trust my doctor. But this time I want to hear other opinions.

Thanks for your time!"

Anxiety,"So many different symptoms out of nowhere,feeling like im dying slow","Welp here i go another day with a feeling of doom. I cant concentrate anymore and everyday to me feels like im closer to dying. I have been having a rough couple of months with what they diagnoed me with is anxiety.i can seem to shake it off and im not my normal self anymore. Ive been feeling every symptom for every disease close to what i google. I know its not good but sometimes i just find the right article or post that relaxes me and at this point i feel ive read em all. I keep thinking ive been misdiagnosed or that they might have missed something. The last  months ive been to the er about  times and ive had bloodwork,ekg, and a scan of my head. I feel as though those tests can only do soo much. Im at the point where i cant sleep at night and am stuck in the same routine to try and not think about it but it comes back harder. Recently ive been having alot of physical symptoms and i keep thinking i have kidney problems or that my organs are alll failing soon and hoping its not too late because ive felt these things for months now. I will admit i had an alcohol problem i started drinking way more and often. Now im regretting this as im stuck on me forsure having kidney or liver problems. I keep peeing clear and sometimes i dont even drink alot of liquid or water in that case. I am now drinking more obviously trying to make up for all the booze i slammed in the past months but figure its prob too late. Im M and really started drinking heavy about  years ago. I feel doomed i had dpdr, head pressure, constant diarrhea from anxiety, dizzyish feeling while walking, change in attitude or as if i suppress things and really feels like a diff kind of anxiety. I used to get the normal shits and or stomach drop from anxiety but evn now thats gone and that is why i think its some underlying issue. I know ive had tests done but i cant get myself to agree knowing damn well im not even a dr and have no say in whats right or wrong. I cant sleep and seem to wake up  mins after and trying to catch zzzs from waking up soo much and having alot of dreams. I know this is a long post but all i need is ig some kind of reassurance.

Anxiety,Ocd or intuition,"What's the difference between ocd and intuition?

Just today after i was talking to my friend and had that feeling i suddenly felt like i should study home instead. I got anxious after the thought popped up into my head and my heart has been racing for a good hour now. I know this might sound stupid but it feels like ill never be able to go out on drives with my friends or make good friends when i go abroad. It feels silly i don't know why i feel like this because realistically speaking i can still make close friends abroad and get a car go out on drives with them etc but i feel like i won't be able to for some unknown reason. now i'm confused whether this is intuition or just ocd. I still feel anxious and like my heart is racing. they say intuition won't make you feel anxious but what does it mean when it feels more right/an easier option but it's also making you really anxious/unsettled physically uncomfortable. am i just scared of change? Im scared and overthinking that i’m just in denial and that i do want to study home i’m just convincing myself that i want to study abroad i hope someone can reassure me lol also how do i make this shit anonymous this is humiliating.."

Anxiety,I started getting help and finally turned to medication (Escitalopram mg),"After a few rough years and random panic attacks that would come to me at the worst of times either in the car on the freeway or at a friends house for a gathering I decided Its finally time to actually try medication 

Has anyone else been prescribed the same medication and dosage as myself and if so when did you start to feel it and how was it? 

This is the first time ever in my life being on medication for this and Im a little nervous honestly,  Year old male and just couldn't keep having this feeling of anxiety sneaking up on me again

Anxiety,Suspending studies on account of anxiety,"I’m considering taking a year out of my studies because my anxiety is making it too difficult for me to study. 

Has anyone else in this group done this before? I’m  years into a  year degree, and I took a gap year before that too so I’m already a year older than my current cohort.

It’s honestly the last thing I want to do but I can’t make it to my college for exams and I can’t take them remotely."

about  years ago we discovered she is asexual and a lot of sexual trauma returned. so we stopped having sex and being intimate. and i have become so scared that i will hurt her if i try to be intimate. we have talked about it. she is willing to try slow. but i can't do anything out of fear. she has no needs and doesn't think about it alot. but im getting extremely touch-starved. we have talked about boundaries and its all clear. but i can't start anything out of fear of hurting her and being rejected, she also knows this and is trying small things. but i feel i should be able to do stuff without completely freezing before even asking for a kiss.   


so basically: we have done all the talking. but any tips for me to get over my fear of hurting someone and being rejected.

Anxiety,How do you deal with communal living anxiety?,"Like many people, mainly due to cost, I live in a flat. It's a building with six flats,  either side and a communal stairway. I am top floor (fortunately) but still suffer from really bad anxiety surrounding other residents. We are always so courteous with regards to noise, especially in communal areas and on an evening. Most other residents appreciate and reciprocate this sort of mentality, after all it works both ways. 

Sadly, there are a few who don't. I have a young nocturnal couple below me whom stomp and bang around until  am, they argue loudly which echoes around the communal staircase. They slam doors and are constantly being heard in one format or another. We have similar directly across, who have no regard to anybody else and will park in other residents spots, dump stuff in the corridors etc.

It's absolutely stressing me out. I feel on edge constantly and I feel it saps my entire enthusiasm to do anything productive due to using all my thought capacity on concentrating on what others are doing, why they are making noise, where they are going etc. I know it's not healthy. It's debilitating. I try and listen to music, to drown out the noise but it never works. I am studying full time so I am home a lot at the moment, I do try and get out as much as possible.

I realise the easy answer is to move, but it's not that simple. We own the flat and are stuck for the time being for a variety of reasons, none of which facilitate a sale and move at the moment. We are working towards making this happen but it is a process and takes time and planning.

I know others experience this, just wondering how people tend to cope and manage their anxiety levels when living amongst other (noisy) people. It makes my life hell. My partner just has an ability to completely drown it out and I am so envious."
Anxiety,You all gotta stop complaining about anxiety.,
Anxiety,I need some help,"I know this is long, but I would really appreciate anything anyone has to offer. Immensely. 
I need some help, or maybe just input from some other perspectives. I’ve been going through some sort of significant mental changes since about November , stemmed from a multitude of reasons that have evolved as my life has changed over the last two years. Recently it’s taken a rather jarring turn that has potential to be really good, or really bad. Basically, I’ve identified the source of a lot of cognitive dissonance in my mind to some overarching thought patterns/habits that have formed and attached themselves to the way I see the world.. as if they’ve become the lens I see the world through. Realizing this was life changing as it made the possibility of improving my mental health very real. It was like shining a flashlight on a monster that’s been lurking in the dark and saying “aha, I see you!” The fact that I’ve identified unhealthy “false” or unnecessary ways of viewing the world around me means I’ve stripped meaning and reality from it, right? I’m finally aware of the lens I see things through. I really need to change, and I thought that recognizing the thought patterns as not real would end my suffering and allow me to form new neural pathways. I think the concept is neuroelasticity or something. However, this has not gone quite as planned. My brain has been in fight-or-flight mode for the last two and a half days. And it’s taking a lot out of me. When I start to make serious progress and feel as if I’m “on top” of that way of thinking, it will always eventually fight back. I’ll get extremely anxious and doubt myself. This doubt is extremely poisonous to progress and ultimately just very distracting and uncomfortable in my daily life. It leaches into every second of my day, no matter what I’m doing. It’s worth mentioning I just moved to a new apartment and started two new jobs, so now is not a great time to be battling that as well. I see that there’s a light at the end of a tunnel, or maybe that’s just what I want to believe. Either way, I need suggestions on how to keep that monster at bay when it feels threatened. I figure if I can make peace with it for long enough I’ll form new habits and see through a cleaner, purer lens. I’ve decided to start writing again, and start making my entries positive and encouraging. I’ve heard this will reinforce the positive voices within you and keep them closer to your memory. Please let me know if theres anything else that may help me. Reading others’ perspectives on this really can help reinforce the positive voices I needed to be attuned to. I’m really, truly ready to fight. I can’t live like this, I want to be better because there is so much to be happy for in the world around me. And I want to participate!"

I don’t know if it’s anxiety, my arthritis and pinched nerve and discs in my neck, or oral cancer. Random quick pains , burning, cold spots, tingling in eye balls , lips, chin, tongue, ear, throat, cheeks, forehead. 

Have a tiny white bump lower front lip been there for I don’t know how long. Painless. I probably wouldn’t have noticed it if my dad wasn’t just diagnosed with tongue cancer. So I examined myself and now I’m fixated and I feel this constant pressure my lower bottom lip and it’s scaring the living crap out of me. I don’t know if it’s genetic but man I have felt sick for a month straight now from the anxiety and I think the random shooting pains and odd sensations are getting worse!

Anxiety,I can’t get out of my head.,"I’m stuck and I can’t get out. I feel like I’m a slave to the thoughts in my head, most of which are negative and dark. I have had anxiety and depression for years but seemed to improve a lot particularly in the last few months. Then  weeks ago, I had a breakdown. Overwhelming feelings of panic, dread, impending doom, hopelessness, and no hope for a future with me in it just cycled in and out for days. 

I feel scatter brained and I can’t focus on anything, especially work. I’m lost in my dark thoughts. And I feel disconnected from the people around me. It’s like they are on one radio airwave and I’m on another. I am so incredible sad and lonely because of it. 

I feel like everyone has learned how to live and I haven’t. I feel like an imposter. I am no longer a positive impact on people, no longer someone people want to be around because I am so sad and negative. I don’t even want to be around me. I feel like I’ve failed. I turn  soon and I’ve wasted my s depressed. I have severe time anxiety and I can’t stop thinking about past mistakes, my perceived failures, where I thought I would end up. I was a high achiever, type A student. And work at a great company. Now I’m on a leave of absence from work because I’m so depressed I can’t function. 

I feel like I have no direction in my life or career. And I’m scared the more I ruminate on these dark thoughts, they will become a self fulfilling prophecy. I will make my thoughts a reality and I’m terrified. 

I’ve been in active therapy for  years doing CBT but I think it’s no longer helpful. I’m thinking of getting another therapist. But I don’t know what kind of therapy or treatment will help. Please help I no longer know what to do and I’m scared."

I can’t even begin to start working on skills when there’s this wall of panic in my way, and it’s infuriating. I just want to do what I love. I thought I was finally getting better and finding ways to handle my anxiety, but CLEARLY based on my stomach trying to start a fucking earthquake every time I try to express myself in song, that’s not the case. It makes me wanna cry, because I love music and specifically singing more that I can even express in words. It’s been a comfort for me for a LONG time."

I am physically shaking, trembling, sick to my stomach, unable to interact with anyone about things that are a problem.  A simply problem with getting a script filled turns into a big mess and I'm calling customer service to complain.  Then I have anxiety about calling in the first place and end up all apologetic like the prescriptions not getting filled is my fault.  It is not.  I just feel and I know it isn't real that by complaining my scripts will never be filled on time again.  This is all in my head but I can't stop it.

This might sound silly but I have a question.  I smoked marijuana frequently  months ago, and haven't had any marijuana in about  months.  I enjoyed it, but near the end it was causing me a ton of anxiety.  So, I stopped.  The only problem is, now if I think I smell it somewhere I panic and think I will get high.  So, I go somewhere and wait for it to ""kick in"" even though it never does.  However, it has lead to panic attacks lasting for up to  hours before, complete with nasty depersonalization, racing intrusive thoughts etc that mimic a bad high.  Has anyone else experienced this before?"
Anxiety,Getting my gallbladder removed in a week and can’t stop overthinking,"I have a single huge stone in my gallbladder, hence why I’m getting it removed. I don’t have much pain or discomfort with it, but I know it has to be done. However, im terrified of going under and complications regarding the surgery. I’m aware it seems to be quite a simple procedure, but just medical things as a whole make me very uneasy. 

I’ve been thinking I’m going to die ever since I was told I needed to be operated, and I’ve prepared everything in case I do die just so it’s less bothersome on my family since I don’t want to add that on top of the possible grief but the date of the surgery is getting closer and I’m getting more anxious by the day. On top of that, I realized my birth control pamphlet mentions that suspending it - weeks before a surgery is best since the chances of trombosis get higher. My doctor mentioned nothing of this despite asking if I was on birth control and asking what brand, he just mentioned there’s an increased blood clot risk and that’s it. 


Dying doesn’t really scare me since I know once I’m dead I’m not going to be feeling anything at all, it’s just I don’t think I’m ready. I don’t want to be a source of suffering for my family and my partner, and I still want to do many things (I’m quite young, )

I’ve had plenty of bad managers and haven’t had a good one until now, and now they’re leaving. Im scared that all the things I love about this job and how it’s positively impacted my life will leave with them. I’m scared that when they find their replacement they’ll be a shitty manager. I’m scared for what the workload will be in the meantime and that I’ll be bad at it and that it will stress me out so much and impact my health. I also have GAD, panic disorder, bipolar , and CPTSD so working has always been really hard for me, especially when I’m in a depressive episode, high anxiety episode, or both. I recently came out of a depressive episode and I was still able to do well in my role during it due to the flexibility despite me having a hard time even getting out of the bed in the morning.

Anxiety,I NEED HELP!!,
Anxiety,"I have about an hour a day to ""train"" my mind and body against anxiety. How would you use the time?","Hi folks. I'm new to this subreddit but have been at a few adjacent ones. I need some help.

Mental Context: I have generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, as well as a fun mix of childhood trauma. I have and manage an eating disorder and compulsive spending, and am in recovery groups for both. I meet biweekly with a therapist. I work with a psychiatrist for medication management. 

Life Context: My wife and I have a . year old baby. I have a dog. I have a full time job that is not too demanding and is work from home.

The Problem: I still have an insanely high baseline level of anxiety when I am with my wife and son. I am good at work and things feel manageable but I regularly have panic attacks over the tiniest things. It's so frustrating and means I can't be there as much as I want to be as a husband and a dad. When I'm there, I'm an awesome partner and dad, but when I'm in the panic, I am not. 

I have looked a lot at my calendar and see I can spend about an hour a day to ""train"" my mind and body to improve this condition. What would you do in my position? What's been your experience that has helped with panic/anxiety attacks and high levels of baseline anxiety? Medication/CBD recommendations are fine, too. I basically am willing to do whatever it takes and I'll carve out the time to do it."
Anxiety,Anxious about going to college everyday,"My final years of high school were spent learning online (bcos, covid) and then i took a gap year to prepare for an university entrance exam. So, I was a homebody for three years and now that I have joined college, I just cannot do it anymore. I dread going to college everyday. I've been skipping classes and hanging out in the canteen bcos my family won't let me skip studies (which is totally fair). Now, i've always been the textbook definition of a ""good girl"" my entire school life, never bunked a single class, never got a detention, etc etc but suddenly i feel so out of breath in college.

Thing is college isn't even bad, teachers are nice and so are my classmates but every morning I feel physically nauseous at the thought of attending college. Now, my college has a strict ""% mandatory attendance"" rule (basically every single university in India, except one) which makes me feel even worse, Idk how im gon do it. My mom would be devasted if they call her to my college bcos of my low attendance. I feel like i'm letting her down and that is my biggest fear. I'm just hoping the attendance rule isn't as strict as they made it sound, or at least that is what some of my friends assure me. I am also late in submitting practicals and assginments (sth which has NEVER happened w me in school), and I've been procastinating. And while trying to finish uni assignments I barely get time to self-study. I used to study for around  hours during my gap year last year, now I can barely get myself to study for two hours a day. God, i feel like an awful, ungrateful and priviledged person even typing this out, bcos i know i could have had it so much worse. I mean people literally lost their lives in c\vid and here I am complaining ab going to classes everyday, and even secretly, and selfishly hoping the classes return online. Also, anyone else feel that anxiety is particularly worse a few days before, as well as during, your periods? No but fr, I hope i can get some studying done, now. bye.

ps- anyone who's having a difficult week, we have got this! ""the darkest hour precedes the dawn"" \~ idk if it's true but i like to think it is, never fails to motivate me, a little at least. english isn't my first language so i apologise for any sort of unintentional mistakes !!"

Anxiety,What should I do?,
Anxiety,Failing healthcare system makes my health anxiety % worse,"I’ve only recently come to the conclusion that what I’m struggling with is health anxiety. It’s not hypochondria - I’m very rational about my symptoms - but a very specific fear that any sudden illness or injury would be left untreated and go septic/get worse. 

For context, I live in the UK, in one of the worst-affected areas of the NHS crisis. People die in A&amp;E daily and you can’t get doctors appointments easily at all. 

I have also just had surgery, which went fine but obviously there are infection risks with any operation, and I’ve had some scares. The news about the NHS is ridiculously distressing and unavoidable. I’m fearful that, should I need an ambulance or other medical attention, it would be inaccessible. I feel such a lack of control!

I was just wondering whether anyone has experience with this specific healthcare-system-failure anxiety? And how do you deal with it?"

I found a thread talking about it and how they couldnt find anything about it. A user said:

“It all usually goes away if I open my eyes or look at my hands or interact with something, but just now I picked up my phone and it felt rediculously thin and small.”

This explains it very well. I used to experience this when i was younger normally at night or early in the morning.

Anxiety,My anxiety is ok but it gets severe time after time ....anyone else experiences this ?,"ok I have general anxiety since   which got worse after   I think

so most times  my anxiety is here with me  but manageable but time after time it gets severe .My mind out of blue finds things to worry about and I keep worrying about it ,feel depressed and feel panic for some months then it passes away and I find another reason to worry about ..It is like vicious cycle 

Things I have obsessed ,worried and panicked about for months ( just some examples so u have an idea ..of course  the list is big :)))  

.when I was religious I was thinking that i was one of the worst sinner in the world and had panic  attacks about it .ended up with self hate and depression

.after loosing faith  I started worrying about the subject of death .It took me several months to calm down a bit 

.For example now I worry  about far future ( I imagine all the bad things which may happen to human race and out planet) I developed this fear after coming across a fun meme about  the earth ...and I googled tons of articles ....

Usually I feel  slight  depression but panic  and fears are the worst to me ...I mean every symptom is horrible but especially panic .

so in general ,my anxiety is always with me but some months are especially hard for me ..then it passes away,i feel a bit better and  then new fear/anxiety comes again ...it is like episodes ,unfortunately psychologists I have visited so far did not understand my case very well .( I live in developing country )

In the past I would lean on “temporary” meds (Xanax and Clonopin) from my Dr to get through temporarily. As seems to be the broad case, she can’t prescribe the amount I need and wants me to use them less. Note that I only really leaned on them a few times in the past - years, but I am unable to sleep, my chest constricts, and my mind fires on so many cylinders I can’t control it.

Does anyone have a safe effective suggestion to help me through this? If past is precedent, it will be a couple more weeks before I believe the catastrophe I’ve devised in my mind is actually not going to happen."
Anxiety,Unforgivable,
Anxiety,Has anyone tried a weighted stuffed animal and found it useful?,"My longtime roommate and her cat moved out and I’m really struggling to cope with being on my own. I know the feelings go beyond my roommate and her cat and they are part of something bigger. I would like to get a pet of my own but I wouldn’t be able to until near the end of Feb, so I was thinking about getting a weighted stuffed animal instead. Has anyone tried this? Was it helpful at all? Thanks!"
Anxiety,Dependence,
Anxiety,I find humor to be helpful in coping with pain and anxiety,"I think about something that hurts me or scares me, and I just start laughing voluntarily. Sometimes it's a fake laugh, but that also works. Science says that real and fake laughter have an equal positive effect on our body. Sometimes I try to see the situation in a humorous way, and then it's a ""real"" laugh. Laugher makes things much lighter.

Here are some great quotes on humor:

By Viktor Frankl from his book Man's search for Meaning (about him surviving a concentration camp):

""Humor was another of the soul’s weapons in the fight for self-preservation. It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds.""

""The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living. Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent.""

By Ken Kesey (From the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest):

""Man, when you lose your laugh, you lose your footing.""

“Because he knows you have to laugh at the things that hurt you just to keep yourself in balance, just to keep the world from running you plumb crazy. He knows there’s a painful side(...) but he won’t let the pain blot out the humor no more’n he’ll let the humor blot out the pain.”

""You can't really be strong until you see a funny side to things.""

By Mark Twain:

""Humor is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away, and a sunny spirit takes their place.""

""Humor is mankind's greatest blessing.""

By Charles Schultz:

""If I were given the opportunity to present a gift to the next generation, it would be the ability for each individual to learn to laugh at himself.""

Hope this helps someone!"

Anxiety,Coffee and Caffeine,"I wanted to share my big win with you, I recently stopped coffee and caffeine in general (including black and green tea) and physical symptoms went down by at least %. I do drink herbal teas, especially chamomile which calms me down almost right away,  


The first  days were difficult because of sleepiness, but I almost never feel the physical symptoms I used to (vertigo, brain zap, heart palpitations, throbbing head pulses).  


Now I drink decaf every now and then but I look at regular coffee as if it's the devil lol, I ain't never touching that cup of anxiety again."

Anxiety,question for medication users only,"I know everyone is different and we will not all work the same with the same meds, but what med worked best for your anxiety? Background im an extremely anxious GAD person. I have health anxiety (specifically heart), ocd, ptsd, and I'm extremely irritable anymore. I keep getting so angry at my boyfriend for not understanding my anxiety and i know its only my fault, not his. So I'm always angry. I want not only relief from my physical and mental anxiety but I want to not care ...I want to be numb so people's words can't get to me anymore and I want to stop getting overly angry. 

Cymbalta kinda worked but the brain zaps were annoying and I heard it's really hard ok the liver (I like a few drinks once In a awhile). Buspar is not working. I been on for . months and upper my dose twice. I'm also on wellbutrin for a yesr and upped that dose  months ago and I see no difference except maybe more anxious. My psychs next step is zoloft or Prozac. I do hear good things about Lexapro but I can't afford to get any fatter. 

Anyone feel like sharing their med experience please. I want to be emotionless"
Anxiety,Anyone else’s anxiety flare up from inactivity/winter time?,"So the title says it all really. M/, was a cab driver about  years before the pandemic. Lot of stuff happened, haven’t really worked since March . Slowly dropped my weight from  to , best shape in  years, but I DON’T FEEL LIKE IT! 

November  started getting chest pains, finally around Easter I had enough and visited an ER, with treadmill test  days later. All good, weighed ~ .
Walked more, bit of Keto,  by Mid-May. Got COVID end of June, sick for a week followed by much brain fog/dizziness, which seems to finally have disappeared…..BUT

I now have digestive issues/GERD with many bouts of anxiety. Gas and burping sometimes for hours, if I don’t fart the pressure builds up in my chest. Thought I had a heart attack /, whole left pec had a jolt, same time as back of my head. Ambulance came, ECG was good(again)  hour wait, it’s not my heart….HAVE NOT REALLY WALKED OUTDOORS SINCE. Heartburn seems to have shifted from chest pain to more of a burning stomach later at night(I never eat past : &amp; go to bed late). Night of ER visit I had a bag of butter popcorn, litre of Pepsi, and was watching a horror movie I had to turn off- but these things never bothered me before. 

Last  days been drinking more water, constipation is much improved. But is sitting around for a month THAT bad for anxiety? Not only is this all so new to me at , but seems like it can’t be a coincidence . But last winter was just the chest, not arm/shoulder/stomach aches like now

Please give me some feedback guys, I have a roof over my head but really need to get back on the workforce and this anxiety is taking over my life daily, can’t get it out of my head. Maybe  more pounds and I’ll feel better. One thing I did right is I NEVER SMOKED"

Anxiety,How do you cope with working?,"I started working full-time in May  at a job I had been working part time since Jan . Honestly it ticks a lot of boxes of what I need for a job: awesome boss; flexible deadlines; little oversight; by myself most of the time; can listen to music. 

But I still struggle with working. I hate going to work; I have an extreme fear of failure that makes me procrastinate; struggle motivating myself while coping with anxiety. I always go to worst case scenario and part of my job is to teach adults which is stressful for me being one of the youngest people here. Also stressed about finances, but I am hopefully only going to be here till June.

One positive note is that I can answer the phone without having a heart attack!

I was just wondering how you guys cope with working and strategies you have for getting through the day? Also wondering how you guys balance energy for work when you have things you need to do outside of work like school work?"
Anxiety,Faint and dizzy when standing up?,"Does anyone else experience this? I don’t think it’s POTS because I had a Holteir monitor done about a year ago which came back fine. Also it doesn’t happen all the time. Usually when I’m anxious.

I’ll stand up and start feeling faint like I’m going to pass out, and my heart races. It only lasts for like  seconds and then I’m fine. And then I get anxious about it and scared to stand up because I’m scared I’m going to faint. It’s really scary. 

I’ve also had blood work done recently, doc thinks I’m fine other than sleep apnea. This symptom is troubling to me though. Anyone else have this issue?"

Anxiety,Constant fear of Deadly Illness,
Anxiety,Do you feel shame for taking meds?,"I just added a second antidepressant to what I've already been taking due to an increase in anxiety, and I realized that I feel shame around taking meds, one, let alone two meds.  To me, I am hopeful that this is just a life circumstances situation, and that once things start coming back together I may not need two meds, but I've been on antidepressants (just one, never a cocktail) for most of my adult life and I've accepted that it is just something that benefits me (and the people around me, as I get really irritable without them, among other things).

I am surrounded by people in my life who are so anti-med for anything, they just hate taking pills, that I secretly feel like they think I'm using meds as a crutch.  They've never said that, but that's how I feel because I know their views on taking medications of any kind.  Yet, I work in the MH field so I'm aware of the stigma and I don't want to be that person that fears being judged for treating my MH."
Anxiety,Fear of bureaucracy,
Anxiety,Was I wrong?,"First day at work where I thought I would start my future. I went into no one knowing who I was, what I was there for, and what I was supposed to be doing. I spent  hours standing up following someone else around who constantly made mistakes with how the work should be completed all while my supervisor was mia and the rest of the time doing absolutely nothing. I contacted my placement coordinator and told someone I was leaving. However I got a call from HR saying I should have went to them and what I did was very unprofessional and I should have contacted my supervisor (who wasn't there and I couldn't meet. My anxiety is now at an all time high and I wonder am I the issue here?"
Anxiety,Counselling Doesn’t Work For Me,Doctors keep insisting I should have more counselling when I’ve had loads of it and it hasn’t worked. I’ve probably had double the amount as well because I’ve been through gender reassignment and they force you to see loads of psychiatrists. My next option is CBT. I’ve never had it but my Doctor says I should have it. I am massively sceptical. My Brother has had it and he said it didn’t make any difference. Do you think doctors just don’t know what else to do with people suffering from anxiety?
Anxiety,Cracking knuckles nonstop,I have a horrible habit that I’ve had for years of cracking my knuckles all day everyday. It gets worse when I’m anxious. Sometimes at night when I’m more anxious I’m cracking literally nonstop and I can’t seem to stop no matter what I try. Does anyone else have this problem? If so how do you work past it?
Anxiety,I feel terrible when I'm happy,
Anxiety,question,"so I’m someone who has a really high sex drive and thinks about sex a lot 

But another thing is my main way of showing affection (relationship wise) is physical affection and or being sexual but it gives me anxiety because I feel like I should feel bad for it 
Or like “what if I have a sex addiction” :/"
Anxiety,What little things do you do to feel better?,"I've got my own list, but I also need some other tips. 

. Hard cardio, to the point of feeling very tired. I do it in the evening when I know it's gonna get bad

. Hot shower, for a long time. 

. Heavy, weighted blanket. And sometimes a heated one. 

. Chamomile tea

. Take a half breath, hold it, let the rest out

. Obsessively doing chores

What works for you? Gonna try some tonight"
Anxiety,It doesn't feel worth living when you're anxious and depressed /,I feel so awful all the time. Always worried about something or just general self-loathing feelings. It doesn't feel like any advice I've heard works. My medication also seems to do nothing. I don't know how I can keep living like this.
Anxiety,Spiraling out of control don't see the end,"I think I (F) fucked up my life forever and I will lose so many things - and people that I LOVE WITH ALL MY HEART. I haven't slept at all in  days and I just think like my options are getting smaller and smaller and I'm afraid of myself.

I married a US Citizen and finally made the move to the States. I went to college in my home country (last class I took was in ) but never finished the degree. There were many possibilities to do so but I fumbled every time. Some because of legitimate crises in my life (bipolar &amp; disabled mom, unemployed dad, financial issues etc) others because of self doubt and procrastination. I'm now a US resident and can't really leave for long periods of time. 

My husbands family are immigrants and mostly came here and became lawyers and are living lavish lives after hard work. I can't help their son with that. 

I'm damaged goods. I don't see a way out. My husband is the most supportive but as he continues to grow in his career path, I fear he will realize it. It doesn't matter how many times he tells me, I can't believe I'm good enough for him. 

I'm at a loss. Starting college from scratch sounds like a nightmare - having to get my HS diploma translated and certified, or even my college credits. This means I have to go back to my home country and go through that grueling paperwork process. I don't even know if I could get my college credits it was so long ago. So many tests I'd need to do.... so many opportunities to just KEEP FAILING :( 

But I know I need a BA at least to make something of myself but I'm so unsure and paranoid and just plain scared. 

I'm hoping to start therapy soon as I think my intrusive thoughts are getting out of control and I need real help."

Anxiety,How are people okay with storms?,"If I told you there was a % chance of a man shooting random people within a five mile radius of you, you’d lose your mind. Everyone would 

But that’s like what tornado watches are. A tornado watch with a level  risk is a % chance of one being within  miles of you. That makes me so anxious 

I have had this fear for so long, and I have yet to hear a perspective to make me feel better about them. Most people literally just don’t worry about it, and will go about their lives like normal"
Anxiety,Diffrent person,"Hey guys,

I cant really explain this but do any of you feel like you cant do anything when dealing with anxiety or panic attacks. For example when I dont have anxiety I feel in control like I can do anything eithout problem, but when anxious I feel like I cant even do basic stuff, like socialize, be good at work etc. 

Feels like I became completly diffrent person.

Had too much caffeine and alcohol after half year, and it probably raised my anxiety quite a lot."
Anxiety,Returning to work,
Anxiety,A thank you to all in this sub,I’ve posted a few times and messaged some others here. This is one of the few subs I see real care and considerate strangers going out their way to help each other. It is a beautiful thing to see and it means a lot to me and so many others.
Anxiety,Health anxiety/Marfans,"I've been having debilitating health anxiety about marfans syndrome for days. I have a narrow palate, i had crowded teeth, i'm ' meanwhile most of my family is short (some of my dads side is tall but my moms is short.) I'm not lanky i'm more on the overweight side. I'm not sure about my wingspan. I'm so anxious it's been causing me not to eat, or even do things that i enjoy. I'm so scared of a chronic illness, it consumes me so badly. I badly want to set up an appt but fear i'll be pushed away due to my health anxiety. anyone have any advice?"
Anxiety,Is this anxiety manifesting in imagination?,"I’m fairly certain this is anxiety. I read online that your environment as a child shapes your imagination. From what I’ve read this comes from your attachment style if it was secure or insecure. Secure would be if you felt safe and insecure would be if you were in survival mode. Therefore your over active imagination can become secure or insecure, a secure imagination would be like unicorns, an imaginary friend, a box is rocket ship or car; something along those lines… I just wanted to share a few odd ways it has been manifesting to see if this has happened to others. Most of there were imaginations I had as a child but some I still struggle with.

. The classic if I don’t go up the stairs fast enough I’ll be killed or murdered or there will be a ghost that will get me.

. If I close my eyes in the shower there will be murderer waiting to kill me when I open them.

. Some terrible thing will happen due to my normal actions, for example a family member will die if I don’t tell them I love them.

. People can read my mind and know what I’m thinking.

. That you’re in a coma and your life is just a dream.

. There will be a demonic creature or intruder waiting for me in the dark during the night."

Anxiety,anxiety chest pain,"so for three weeks now ive had bad muscle tension in my back, shoulders, arms, neck, and underarm area. ive also been getting chest pains on both sides and in the middle of my chest but mostly the left side, and its starting to really worry me. my muscle tension isnt easing up and my back is really stiff, and i keep feeling these chest pains. ive checked my pulse and bpm on a little machine i have and everything there is normal but the pains persist. i haven’t gone to the doctor because everyone around me insists its anxiety related and ill be fine in a few days but im just not sure. the pain feels like little cramps, not a stabbing pain. i keep thinking what if something is wrong with my heart and the muscles are tight because my heart is overworking itself? my chest does occasionally feel stiff, but sometimes the muscles dont feel sore to the touch but i still get the chest pains. does anyone have a similar experience? should i go to the doctor?"

Anxiety,Entropy and Loss of Concepts,"My name is Matthew, I’m a  year old man who has ADHD, Depression, and of course.. Anxiety. For the past few months, my memories and understanding of the world has been deteriorating, sometimes it feels like it’s getting worse.. and sometimes it feels like it’s getting better. Sometimes I’ll catch myself looking at an everyday word and tilting my head at it in confusion since it looks like it was spelled wrong..
Sometimes I catch myself questioning the concept of language and biology.. I’ll be having a fun time or relaxing and then it’ll hit me.. where I just don’t understand things like reality and up feeling confused and empty. I questioned if I had derealization.. and I think that it is part of what I’m going through, or dissociation, because I will question why I’m at a place or what the point of it is. Recently I’ve realized that my home no longer feels like my home, I’m confused by it, I’m frightened by it almost. I’ll feel like I should be living at my last home or think my street lay out is something else despite living here for three years. Nothing feels right anymore. 

I want to live again. I feel like my brain is deteriorating and dying, and soon I’ll lose all my memories, all concepts of reality, cognition, and then.. nothing. I have to remind myself all the time that this is real, and tell myself my own name along with the friends I’ve come to love. I feel truly helpless, hopeless. I’ve done an MRI and Blood Work.. nothing came up. They said I look like a healthy  year old. I do not know what I can do anymore. Do I just.. submit to these symptoms and either fall into a deep depression? Or do I just.. deteriorate and possibly die from this.. I question if it’s something like dementia but.. even then the MRI would’ve noticed something because of my age and would’ve looked more like an older person’s brain. So.. I’m stumped!"
Anxiety,months into my new job having major anxiety about a weekly meeting I lead,"I know it's only been three months, but I can't help but feel my anxiety sky rocket at this job, even though it's way easier than my last. We don't go in every day (which is fine by me) but I improve upon acquaintance so it's been really hard for me to let my guard down among my coworkers, even though I really want to. I just assume I shouldn't join in on a conversation, or lunch, etc bc indont want to interrupt.

 I feel my guardedness is making me unapproachable and they probably all think I'm a bitch even though I'm just shy and anxious. 
What's worse is I am at the point that when I speak--ugh I don't even want to breathe life into this--i feel they are making fun of me. I can't shake this feeling. I have to run a really open ended meeting every week. I used to do this all the time, but I felt comfortable on my old team and there were more swimlanes, more direction. 

Now, I'm not sure which direction to go in, and there was no real training to be had. My manager told me he treats it like a conversation, but the times I've done it there are large stretches of silence where no one participates. I can feel my face going red and choking up while they stare at me blankly. I feel  years old again. 

I can mask pretty well, but I feel like I'm in open water and my mask is crumbling. I can't focus during the meeting bc I am so concerned with planning what I'm going to say next. 

My friends tell me well who cares what they think? I just can't help it. And this loop of bad thoughts is keeping me frozen and scared. I don't want to ruin this opportunity for myself. I try to get drinks with them when I can which has actually been sort of helpful but not completely. 

What should I do? How can I reframe this?"
Anxiety,what can I do to help myself,"hi, I’m , f and every day of my life my mind is beating me up, I am anxious every single day, I can’t do anything without worrying about it, I take medication I have to check it  times, I can’t go to shops, I can’t answer my phone, I am seriously not functioning right now and it’s making me so depressed. Every thought I have is negative and it’s like my mind is racing  mph with bad scary thoughts of what could happen to me. all I want is the thoughts to stop I want to be happy I want to just function I am absolutely exhausted and at the end of the line with feeling like this. It’s boring and miserable being scared of literally everything."
Anxiety,Where can I get effective/safe vitamins/supplements?,"I have been hearing somewhat about vitamins from multiple people. I was wondering where to buy them though? Feels weird buying them off a random site because ""natural vitamins"" sounds like a lot scammers would take advantage of. I get sketchy vibes. Specifically I am thinking of taking L-theanine (I believe it's called that) I have taken magnesium to sleep before which has somewhat helped (I saw it in store.), not sure if it's placebo but worth it to do. I appreciate any recommendations of where to buy them or other vitamin recommendations."

I need this place to let some out so I don’t take my crazy out on the people most important to me right now.  I have to hold myself together enough to make sure nobody, especially my wife, asks me what’s wrong.  If that question comes up I will end up getting overwhelming and say shit I will regret.  I can’t create any more regrets.  

I am strong.  I trust myself to hold this together.  I am stronger than the things that happen in the world around me.  I am blessed and a blessing to those around me.

Anxiety,Advice needed,"Hello everyone, currently in need of some advice for some anxiety “ticks” I developed. I have unfortunately picked up very bad habits to the point that it’s causing discomfort. I know I won’t get permanent solutions but I am trying to prevent anymore discomfort in the mean time. The “tick” I picked up is that my skin will feel itchy and sometimes depending on my stress it will burn. In the process of that I tend to scratch (sometimes not aware) and I end up causing my skin to flare up. I have tried ointments and even cutting my nails to lessen the discomfort. I was wondering what type of clothing would help suppress that or are there some special gloves I’m able to use on a daily basis. 

Any advice is welcomed. I just want to feel at ease. Thank you."

Well I have, and I don't know how to make it stop... I know I can't control the circumstances or other people. I know that I'm anxious and hurt feeling. I recognize that I have no power to do anything. I don't judge how I'm feeling, I understand it. With all of this, I still can't make it stop. I've tried breathing exercises, cold water cool downs, ignoring it and distracting myself with work... The thoughts just pop in my head and I'm getting so sick and tired of yelling for the th time for it to stop. It's so distracting I can't get stuff done. I have practiced enough that I can most of the time recognize when the thoughts appear and I instantly go wait a min hold on no no no shaking my metaphorical finger at the negative thought. Telling myself there are no facts to support my fears and my brain is being irrational. Yet nothing changes, I still feel anxious and restless, like if I lose control for one second I'll explode. I don't have tolerance for anything bad to happen anymore... I can't..handle..more."

Anxiety,Asthma like symptoms from anxiety (not attacks)?,"First off, I have seen a doctor and had lung x-ray done, as well as blood work and other tests and gotten an inhaler until I get the results, I am just curious of your thoughts about this, as I have been thinking about it for a couple of days. 

&amp;xB;

Is it possible to have non stop, physical symptoms like shortness of breath and tightness around the chest from anxiety alone? 

Background: I've had severe anxiety since I was about , it has had its ups and downs but it has always been really bad. I am right now in a real low point in most aspects of my life and of course, my anxiety has followed along. I have been feeling constantly overwhelmed by just eating a meal every day and in the past few weeks I started having some trouble breathing and found myself constantly out of breath, like after an intense work out, but from sitting by the computer, getting worse as soon as I got up to walk to the bathroom and stuff like that. It got worse for a couple of days until I went to the ER. I haven't gotten any test results back yet, but I have been considering if this might actually be a mental thing. 

&amp;xB;

Has anyone experienced long lasting physical symptoms like this? I don't mean during panic attacks, I mean all the time for several days. It has been fairly OK during the mornings and gotten progressively worse as the day goes by, with the evenings being just awful. Google wasn't of much help so I thought I'd ask here."
Anxiety,"because of my anxiety, I have trouble sleeping normally and I need advice","So as the title says I have anxiety, now I have two related problems and I don't know if anyone has the same thing or if anyone managed to fixed them. 
. I can't fall asleep without using my phone, I keep using it doing different things as long as it keeps my brain from screaming and having different voices at the same time thinking of multiple topics at the same time, I tried relaxing herbal teas and soft music but they don't work, did any of you try something that can allow me to stop using my phone in bed? 
. Because of anxiety and my brain working /, I'm never in deep sleep, I wake up multiple times a night because of tiny reasons (my cat moving, my roommate turning the light or waking up, even a low sound coming from afar) and once I wake up it takes me at least  hour to fall back asleep.. and I have to go through my phone again..

Anxiety,Thoughts on this video,"I was curious if anyone has watched this video on anxiety and what your thoughts were about it.  I just listened to it on my way home and I thought it made a lot of sense and was refreshing.  However, there was a part of me that felt uneasy about the anti-medication vibe.  I take meds.. I think they help me.  But maybe they aren’t the best solution?"
Anxiety,"anxiety, psychosis, drug addiction and alcoholic mother","Dear redditors,

I have nobody who i can talk to at the moment so i thought i would turn to reddit. Excuse my Bad grammer please because I am on mobile and currently having a panic attack. I will try to keep myself short and would appreciate any help


I am a male in his early s and I have been struggling with on and off drug addiction for the past  years. I have been struggling with mental health issues since i was a kid and never went and got any help.  years ago i decided I was done with life and attempted suicide  times and failed both times. I turned to drugs because of childhood trauma and quickly got into a self destructive cycle. It is honestly a miracle that i am still alive considering the amount of drugs i consumed. Recently I have learned to appreciate the small things in life and decided it was worth giving life a another shot. I was hospitalized twice after suffering psychosis and severe Panic attacks but they have never put me in a psych ward or took me seriously. I decided to cold turkey benzos and stimulants (I know i know) and am currently in withdrawal. Staying away from drugs is honestly Not that hard at the moment because I know that i will suffer another Panic Attack and land in a psych ward if i Touch that stuff again. Well as you have probably guessed I have not been very functional for the past  years and have been a burden for my parents especially since they know nothing about my addiction and its hard to reason with them. My parents are divorced and still live in the same Apartment because of financial issues. My dad has become mentally abusive and my mom has become a full blown alcoholic. On some days she will Drink nothing and act normal and on Other days she will Drink a whole bottle of Whiskey and Start arguing with my dad. My dad has put his hands on her once before and it has come to a Point where i am afraid to leave the Apartment as soon as they start arguing because i fear that my dad will lose it and beat her up. It's like her whole personality Changes when she gets drunk and she keeps on yelling and saying the stupidest things. My mom has had brain surgery  times and her health is declining fast since she has been sitting at home for the past few years and doing nothing but Smoking cigarettes and drinking. I got my own Apartment a couple months ago because i didn't want to watch my parents fight constantly but yet i still sleep at my parents House because i am afraid that something will happen between them. My dad offered to Take the Apartment so i can live with my mother but i cant watch her slowly kill herself anymore and live in this Environment. I honestly have no Idea what to do or where to even start. I used to do great in school but couldn't graduate because of my mental health issues and drug addiction. I plan on Going Back to school and getting my Diploma but i just cant with this much on my mind. Atleast i will have a full time job next month and my dad wont have to Help pay for my Rent anymore. I feel like so much is on my shoulders because my parents always Tell me to make something Out of myself because they have given Up on themselves already. I suffer from full blown Panic attacks every night, cant sleep, Hallucinations and Hearing Things i just feel like i am a ticking time bomb... Im sorry for this chaotic post im just lost. My parents have always been good parents and Made Sure i Had everything i needed but never showed me much affection in the Sense of telling me they love me or hugging me. We arent that Close but i love them and i wish everything could get better"

Anxiety,Does anybody know where I can get an SSRI prescribed to me?,My doctor will not prescribe an antidepressant but for some reason will prescribe Clonazepam and I don’t want to get addicted to it.

Anxiety,Most effective anxiety treatment,"I don’t know if any of you would agree with this, but last year I found a very effective treatment for my anxiety. It’s to remember that it is okay to have anxiety. To actively accept my anxiety. To stop trying to constantly “get rid of it” which always made me feel worse or like a failure. I know that sounds silly. I also know anxiety can come with awful feelings and physical effects that are problematic. But if you’re ever struggling and can’t seem to find any solution, try telling yourself it’s okay! You can be anxious! You are still alive and what you’re experiencing is okay. I often find that calms me down when I feel myself spiraling into a panic attack. Ironically, fully accepting myself and the situation often prevents it from getting worse."
Anxiety,Exhaustion from anxiety (TW: Emetophobia),"Trigger warning for emetophobia — throwaway for privacy reasons.

Honestly, I don't even know why I'm posting this. But then again, I don't know why anything happens to me lol, so I guess it doesn't matter. I'm a young woman with bright prospects and a lot of success ahead of me, and yet the fear I collected from some nasty kid projectile vomiting on the carpet in kindergarten on the first day when I was  still haunts me. The intensity of the fear comes and goes, sometimes becoming debilitating, sometimes hardly noticeable. Right now, it is debilitating, and has been for about a month. I've gone longer in this state, but I mean, it's still ass.

Probably wouldn't come as a surprise that I am diagnosed with panic disorder and OCD, the latter frustrating me more than anything at the moment because it had been gone for so long. My panic disorder is much more manageable now than it used to be, but I've been having a bit of a flare-up. Maybe it was finals, maybe it was coming home and having to adjust locations, maybe it was flu season, maybe it was all of it. I actually caught the stomach flu about a week ago, and on a positive note, I handled it in a way I thought I would never be capable of. I was really strong for myself, and I don't know, maybe it seems silly but I was really proud and still am. It's not really possible to put into words what it used to be like when I would get sick. It was panic so severe all I can remember are painful, vivid flashes of a bathroom, memories that like to conveniently come back when I need them not to. When I have panic attacks my entire body feels like its burning, my stomach lurches, and all I can do is pace back and forth because if I don't move I'll scream. Sometimes at my worst, I did scream. Scream, and hurt myself hitting things around me. Not anymore, thankfully.

The intrusive thoughts are the worst part. My mind can remember everything. I can recall if I touched and unclean surface and then touched my face, precisely when it happened, and what might happen. I often track when I've eaten food to know when I would know if I had food poisoning. (Very few foods do not make me feel this way, specifically ""safe restaurants"" and home-cooked food, which logically is nonsense but... whatever). I will also stay up until midnight because 'I would know by then if I was sick', and it has been depriving me of sleep. Unfortunately, my terror of waking up to have to vomit has made it impossible to stop this behavior at the moment. All of this is of course mental checking, a symptom of my OCD — and while it is nice to know why I do it, it is much harder to make it stop, which I'm sure many of you get. It's a constant grasp for control over something I just simply do not have control over, and I am exhausted beyond words. It takes up all of my energy.

Like I said, I don't really know why I'm sharing all of this. It feels nice to put it into words like this, in front of me in a way I can process. Sometimes seeing everything like this makes it easier for me to say 'hey, maybe this isn't so rational'. But, I kind of feel like I wanted to put this out into the mass that is the internet just so maybe, for a moment, I don't feel so crushingly alone. I have amazing/supportive friends and family, so it isn't that. But when you're in the thick of it, unable to escape your own mind, it can be the most isolating thing. Nobody can help you except yourself at the end of the day, and that journey is scary. And, to be fair, I shouldn't be all doom and gloom because I have made an extraordinary amount of progress, despite how it might seem to me right now. I've never been one to let things stop me, and I am not a quitter. I deal with some pretty formidable mental health issues, both with this and in other things, but I have a lot of hope for myself and my future. I can't let go of that, because it's my fuel.

TL;DR — I've got terrible, crippling emetophobia, but I know it'll be okay soon."

Anxiety,Anxiety over keeping house,"As someone who has suffered with GAD for many years, I've been having a bad bout of anxiety lately and it seems to stem from the cleaning/organizing/maintenance of my place. We rent a condo, and it seems like I can just never stay up to date with cleaning as I would like, I have what feels like lots to organize and declutter (closets and pantry are a disaster! guestroom is basically a storage room at this point), and anything maintenance-wise that comes up really throws me into a tizzy.

I have been trying to make efforts to knock things off my to-do list (deep clean oven, dust tops of ceiling fans, etc.) but it seems to take so much effort and give me so much anxiety, which doesn't make a lot of sense. I am always scared that my landlords are going to think I don't keep things up to par and want to kick me out, even though I just had my landlord over today while some workers were putting in a new water heater (another huge anxiety! I am always worried that repairs won't go as planned and will end up costing my landlord way too much) and she was saying how good the place looks (but she didn't look in any of my overstuffed closets LOL). I have several friends who are ""neat freaks"" and I think I am comparing myself to them too much since their houses always look magazine-perfect. I have lived here for  years so I know wear-and-tear happens but I just feel like I should be doing a better job. I'm not in filth or hoarder level territory - but I just don't feel like I keep a tidy enough house, if that makes any sense?

Anyway, I follow KC Davis who has a lot of advice about this kind of thing and that's helpful, but I was wondering if anyone else has anxiety over this specific stuff. My husband broke one of our blinds recently and it's giving me an exaggerated amount of anxiety, even though we can fix it and even afford a new set of blinds if need be. Just a really weird manifestation of anxiety!"

Anxiety,dr appt anxiety vent,"So I was just at my after hours urgent care for an x-ray of my elbow (I tripped and slammed it into a doorframe a couple days ago and its still hurting) to rule out a small fracture. Well, they send me to imaging, and the woman sets my arm up on the x-ray table, just positions my arm, and I wait, thinking she's going to grab one of the shield aprons for me.


No, she goes and fires off the machine and takes several pictures, while my whole upper body was still basically under the whole apparatus (genuinely I feel like the picture should look like a forearm then the back of my skull and shoulders), she didn't tell me to move out of the way or anything. She comes back to position my arm again, and the same thing happens, mostly because I was too dumbstruck to say anything when I realized it happened the st time.


Finally, when she comes for a rd reposition, I'm feeling brave enough to say something and ask about the shield, and she says, "" Well, you said you weren't pregnant, and it's such a small amount.""


I still feel like that was really not okay, and I'm trying not to spiral about it. Not really sure what's absolutely bothering me but just the fact it feels like she was unprofessional about not offering it, not telling me what she was doing and when and blowing me off when from what I believe, it's supposed to be a standard safety measure. Like at the dentist, you get the full body bib.

I hate that the majority of my anxiety and intrusive thoughts are always about my health and body."

I have the day off tomorrow for a remote job interview for something I REALLY want and need to spend more time preparing for it, but it's hard to calm down.

I'm on meds for anxiety but I'm thinking it's time to change them or increase them.

I’m barely making it. I had an EKG come back normal but he still referred me to a cardiologist whom I meet with on Friday. 

And I’m starting EMDR this coming week too. 

BUT THESE PANIC ATTACKS! They’re not like that they used to be. They don’t stop. They don’t let up. I get lightheaded now too. And nauseated. Xanax barely touches them. My coping techniques I developed don’t help. My ENTIRE day is spent just surviving.

Anxiety,Cant Vibe,"A frustrating aspect to my anxiety is my inability to vibe with people.

I recently moved across the country for work and I don’t know anyone out here. I want to make friends and I want to get along with my co workers.

Thing is I’m always awkward and anxious around everyone. I try to pretend I’m comfortable and able to joke around but I really can’t do it authentically and I can see people catching on.

My anxiety feels like a dark secret and enough time passes and my fronts can’t hold up and people start to see through it and into my ultra anxious awkward core. There are also those evil inquisitors who seem able to spot it immediately and then derive pleasure from exploiting me and triggering me worse.

I can’t vibe! I can’t joke around.

It frustrates and worries me that the new guy at work vibes and jokes around with the crew better than me.

I took a big risk coming out across the country to start a new career in something I don’t think I’m naturally good at but something I want to learn and become good at anyway. All the pressure and anxiety related to that is frustrating. On top of that my social anxiety and my need to feel like I fit in is making things really tough."
Anxiety,Muscle Weakness throughout body,"hey guys, my wife and I got Covid about  days from now. We got over it fairly fast wasn’t too severe pretty mild.

The entire time I’ve had Covid I’ve been having panic attacks which is fairly new to me and I mean severe panic attacks where I couldn’t even function properly. I had an appointment with my PCP yesterday and he basically said that he’s not sure why my muscles are the way they are but he then prescribed me Clonazepam. It definitely seem to work well and calm me down but it has been two days and my muscles are still pretty bad. I’m worried it could be something more serious like GBS… can anxiety and panic attacks cause this type of muscle weakness and issues?

This usally comes out of nowhere. i will be playing with my kids, or driving home from work, pretty calm and out of nowhere it hits me. This has happened to me  times in the last  months. So random. Not sure how concerned i should be. Anyone with a similar experience? Looking for some advice/guidance on what i could be going through.

Anxiety,Voice projection issues,"Does anyone else have a hard time projecting their voice, or gauging how loud they are? Growing up my mom would constantly yell at me for being too loud or yelling. She’d say “whisper” or “use your indoor voice”. But I’m well into adulthood and I have zero idea how to gauge how loud I am and my boyfriend has been getting frustrated with me because I start speaking clearly and slowly turn the end of my sentences into a whisper and he can’t understand what I am saying. It’s a daily struggle, and I understand why it would frustrate him. But I just don’t notice I am doing it. Idk if it’s tied to social anxiety and adhd. But if I spend all day focusing on how well I’m projecting my voice I wind up irritated and exhausted. My brother is the only person who doesn’t have a hard time hearing me. We grew up close so maybe he’s just use to it, but he constantly communicates for me when other people say “what” after I speak.

Anxiety,Do you always have a headache when you sit down on your desk?,"Hi everybody, this is my first post. I think I'm suffering from a combination of anxiety, depression and self doubt at work.

When I'm at work, even after a long night's rest, whenever I sit myself in front of a computer, I always get a headache before starting my work. I think part of it has to do with the fact that I'm both anxious and sometimes annoyed when I have to start something I don't understand or something complicated like fixing a mess from another coworker (who doesn't even work there anymore). 

It's made me consider whether it's because of my physical health, the work I'm doing, or if I really just don't like the profession I studied in (architecture). 

I'm seeing a therapist and maybe even a career advice counselor this month and I'm hoping that it can resolve some of struggles I face while at work."

Anxiety,Horrible anxiety about caring for newly adopted cat,"I adopted a new cat this week - she's  years old and really sweet. I adopted her after losing my  year old cat this year who was my best friend - it really devastated me.

My new cat ended up getting constipated which isn't unusual for a stressful situation. But One thing I've noticed is that when she is playing on my rug, she might catch a whif of something from the rug and her face reacts negatively - it's not the ""stinky face"" like you see cats do, but it's more like, ""oh man i inhaled something I'm allergic to"" and then she'll run away really fast.

I'm really really anxious that the rug has some sort of allergen in it and I'm anxious that I'm compromising her welfare. My last kitty seemed to have allergies towards the end - although it was throughout multiple apartments with different furniture.

I'm just really anxious that I'm making her sick and hurting her.

I'm admittedly a pretty messy person and I'm kind of overwhelmed about the idea that this is impacting her health. 

I'm considering hiring a cleaning service but in the meantime I'm tempted to just throw out my rug even though i love it.

No matter what I tell myself or what actions I do to help with the anxiety, it doesn't improve. On days I have class, I feel that I mentally skip the rest of the day, knowing that there's going to be class at the end of it.

I need some reassurance that everything will be fine. Also, should I push to have them put me under? I'm already worried about having an anxiety attack on the OR table."
Anxiety,cardiophobia. again.,
Anxiety,i miss when anxiety was just anxiety.,"growing up, i’ve always had anxiety. as a kid i would have panic attacks which made me throw up, but i would realize it was all in my head and feel better as soon as i threw up and got it out. i felt anxious only from time to time, but i knew it was anxiety, and i knew it would always get better.

now, my anxiety is debilitating. it is all day, every day. it manifests itself in physical symptoms that never go away. it is one long panic attack, but this time, i don’t feel like it is just “all in my head” and that i can just throw up and move on. i’m always dissociated, i feel out of it all the time, hearing about things i see on the news send me into existential crises. i constantly fear that my life is in danger and my health symptoms take over everything. i wanna go back to the old days when anxiety was just anxiety and i could live my life normally, besides the occasional panic attack. i’m sick of living every day like there is impending danger and not being able to escape the thoughts that take over. 

please, if anyone else feels similarly, please let me know your tips. it also just helps to know i’m not alone in feeling this way :)"
