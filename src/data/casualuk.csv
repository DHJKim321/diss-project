CasualUK,My only wish for  if for everyone to shut the fuck up about  in a,
CasualUK,I hope  is kind to everyone,"So I was unsure whether to post this. It's quite an easy thing to say appreciate what you have and spend time with those you love. It's a very common advice that's thrown around but I encourage everyone reading to reflect.

This year has possibly been one of the worst I've endured despite a lifetime of mental illness and loss. , I walked out of a longterm relationship and equally long career without thinking or trying to better myself. Both were the best things I had in life but I let the depression take over and had no chance of recovering either.

Then, on the exact same day I lost my grandma  years ago, my grandad past away. Back then, I made a promise to myself to visit my family and better myself all those years ago. I failed. Fortunately, and on a whim, I had seen my grandad the day before. It was still a shock despite knowing his long term illnesses, he looked the healthiest he had in years.  days before Christmas.

After a year of losing hope in everything, it could've been the final straw. This time I have started to live up to that promise I made. Time is fleeting, I could regret all the time I spent in my own head but instead it is the time to make the real difference for both myself and my family. Losing truly wonderful human connections was the catalyst that I shouldn't have realised this late.

My message to all you fantastic people and this community is to never take anything for granted, ring your friends, visit your families, make life involve the people who wish nothing but the best for you. Make that new years resolution not some radical change in life but enjoy what you have so you don't ever have to regret. 

Mental health is such an awful thing to deal with. We talk about it so often on the Internet but it isn't always taken seriously in real life by others but especially ourselves. We can make it. Its unfair that we have to expend more energy than most to try 'fix' ourselves but it's my belief that it is worth it. Others love us so much, we have to love ourselves.

Take care and a happy new year x"

Is your birthday in January?

Are you sick and tired of getting unwanted Christmas returns as birthday presents?

Are you done with people giving it all ""Oh, I'd love to come out for your birthday, but I'm all spent up after Christmas, just like the last  years I've made the same mistake without learning.""?

Is your inbox just a sea of January Sales offers for shit you don't even use, or ""nEw YeAr, nEw yOu"" gym bollocks?

Well, as your slightly older brother from another mother, I just want you to know that we all share your pain, and we fuckin' see you. So...

 May none of your r/casualuk threads get removed by the automod bot being the ban-happy bugger he is

 May the broadband in your area get upgraded to double the speed for free

 May ""Mrs Brown's Boys"" be added to the ""banned literature"" list on your birthday

 May your Dry January be inclusive of dry ciders, dry white wines, and dry gins

And above all...

 May your actual birthday be reet proper good, like.

Yours, a December Baby who promised he'd stand by you lot, too."

&amp;xB;

Robinsons used to be my household favourite.

Schweppes cordial was the best cordial I experienced, working behind a bar.

Mi Wadi have had their moments, but I found it to be middle of the road. 

Tesco's were useless

Asda's special cordial was even worse

Lidl's blackcurrant cordial is just an abomination."

When he’s in prison he gets put in a cell with loads of thin black guys who spend years bedding the bars of the cell window to escape. Eventually they bend the bars far enough to escape but the American guy is too big to get out and gets left behind. Seem to remember the African guys saying that if they can get their head through the bars then the rest of their body will fit through as well so they were measuring the gap by putting their head up gain at the bars

It’s been bugging me for years trying to find the name of it

Unfortunately where she is sleeping, I won't be able to get a good crack at her and everything I read online said not to wake a sleeping queen as she will be absolutely bloody livid and go for you! 

Considered firing something at her but there is no way I could get down loft ladder quick enough and close it without feeling her wrath. 

Don't want her making her nest up there when she wakes in spring and smacking her but not killing her is even worse as ill almost certainly not know where she has fallen and won't be able to find her again until her full army of bastard kids is building the nest.

Help me good people of Reddit"

But recently I could hear her tv going on and ridiculously she only has her tv turn on around : til -am in the morning depend on day to day. I have tried ear plug but hurt my ear so badly, its not very comfortable to wear every day. I also have a mid ages mom that very sensitive to noise, lately both of us could barely get some sleep. It really giving me stress and anxiety. So I decided to came and talked to her. Somehow she is very grumpy and not very happy when I told her that even tho I asked very nicely and take the blame, and just asked if the could maybe turn it down a bit coz if affecting us. Then she told me that she don’t think her tv is that loud, as she never get a complaint, its so hard to show her. I cannot tell her that oh come over at  in the morning to hear your tv sound, it’s ridiculous, also she could turn it down and pretend like it not that loud or something. Also weird that I can hear with my ear very clear but when I try to record or take a video it could not capture it. 

Now I just have to wait til im very tired to get to sleep. I really don’t want to bring this to the council as I don’t want to cause trouble, and I am not able to move to other place. Ive looked online for sound proof installation but very pricey.

Open sign and sometimes I can see someone behind the counter. Just no one in. I've sometimes wondered if these are just money laundering operations. You know when you end up with k to launder so you make up
a false till roll. Like that US TV show I can't remember the name of. But if so, why a YogBar? Surely there's a more plausible business? Like Plumberu? Or is it because they want plausible deniability in the sense that they cant say who their customers were because they were in and out, bought a Yog special for
 quid, and paid in cash.

But, at the same time, I might be missing out on a lovely Yog in the rain windswept north? I could just be a philistine.

CasualUK,Deck Goose &amp; Deck Duck: A CasualUK Tale,"Hi all, I've posted this story privately but thought this sub might enjoy it as well.

I work on a survey ship in the North Sea and it's not uncommon for small birds to land on the ship when they're tired. They often do not last long, they are exhausted and hungry already and there is little we can do for them. But on my last trip, doing some work just off the coast of Anglia, we were joined by a goose. I believe it was a bean goose and it just landed on our back deck one day.

It was doing very squirty movements, which implied it may have been unwell, so my colleagues and I put out some freshwater for it and looked up what sort of food is good for a goose of that size. We mainly fed it muesli, not expecting it to stay long, but other more scientific (we had marine biologists onboard) types suggested fresh vegetables such as peas or lettuce. It loitered on the stern and seemed as cautious as any wildfowl would be, but it ate our food and seemed to glug down freshwater a lot.

A couple of days later, a female mallard joined him. I have no idea why she landed as well but we all joked, ""Oh bloody hell, we're starting a bird sanctuary here.""

The two followed each other around everywhere. The mallard was actually quite ballsy, and would push the goose out of the way at feeding time. We made sure to feed them separately as a result. By this point, we had actual work to do but an unspoken rule between shift handovers was the state of Deck Goose and Deck Duck and if they'd eaten or not.

The weather was rough. For a fair few nights, we would wait it out and it was fine indoors but the deck was getting swamped and I did worry about them but, come the morning, they would come waddling up to say hello. I was genuinely surprised they made it through the rough weather; the North Sea in November does not mess about.

Eventually, we went to port at Den Helder in the Netherlands. I was on-shift was we headed in and noticed that Deck Goose disappeared shortly before we went alongside. I guess all the deck activity scared him off but we were next to land, so at least he could look for shelter. Deck Duck was reluctant to leave, though, and a colleague and I had to pick her up and let her fly off the stern. I know that might sound mean but a working ship is no place for a wild animal and she had a better chance on land than the middle of a sea. She looked a little miffed but, by the next morning, she had flown off.

I miss Deck Goose and Deck Duck. It was two weeks where we all had a couple of little guests and nobody on the crew seemed to mind. We made sure to wash the deck of their poop (they did poop a lot) and I was worried somebody might see it as a health issue but it was never raised. Hopefully they are chilling in Holland now, on a little pond with their pals."

If you have a sink with two taps, separate hot and cold, and you want to wash your face, say in the morning or evening: do you cup your hands under the cold for a few seconds, and then under the hot for a few seconds to get a good mix and temperature of water?

Also separate question, but related. I was reading about household water systems in UK homes. Is there some kind of unpressurized tank in the attic for I think the cold water? And so the cold taps are just under gravity pressure, whereas the hot water taps are pressurized? I’m just curious if anyone has a good synopsis of a “typical” residential household water system."

It was a chicken sandwich in their fabulous soft white bread, with a mixed leaf salad and had this amazing mango flavoured mayonnaise. Maybe with a little hint of chilli/spice? The carton it came in was in the shape of steps.

Can anyone remember this?? None of my friends remember it and think I've made it up.

I can vividly remember it and can almost taste it. I used to get  every Saturday as far as I can remember. I was in my mid teens then.

If it was a real thing, is there any info or images online? Anywhere to say it's been discontinued? Is there a copycat recipe for it? Or at least just for that epic mango chilli mayo? Does anyone else do a similiar sandwich?

Hours of fun! At harvest we'd all carry our little tins down to the alter for the food bank and sing that song about onions and autumn days when the grass is jeweled. 

Does anyone else remember Christingle? I am often accused of making it up by people who never went to church. You'd take an orange with a ribbon wrapped around it, stick a candle in the top and four cocktail sticks. You'd then cover the sticks in dolly mixture and the reverend would light the candle, and all the children would carry their flaming oranges through the church and sing in a procession. Then if you got caught eating the sweets, they'd tell you off and say the sweets were for Jesus so you were being sinful. I don't know why God needs dolly mixtures anyway."

Its  degrees outside so it's not too cold but it is spitting and its been howling in the garden since about  this morning till now and this isnt the first time. We live in a new build estate and they are two doors down and it's very loud and annoying. They have two small kids that also seem to get locked in the garden when the mum is angry at them. They knock on the door and cry until the mum comes out and has a go at them loudly (that's another story). We have also adopted one of their cats. We have two cats of our own that enjoyed playing with the other cat. We started feeding it and it would eat the food like it's never been fed before, now we feed it  times a day and it stays with us pretty much all day now and happily sits on our laps and sleeps on the bed.   I feel they have neglected him too. I've never owned a puppy or dog before and wanted to know should I do anything or is this normal? I just cant bare to hear it whimpering and crying in the rain. Thanks for any help.

They could not get on the same page, then dude  said that this is for example illegal in UK ... ""he has a friend"" ...

CasualUK,"Was there a thing called ""The Lighting of the Fleet"" in the 's and, if so, what was it about?","One of my earliest memories is going to see something that everyone was calling ""The lighting of the fleet"".  It happened off the South Coast, probably Portsmouth and was the Royal Navy lighting up all their boats.  I just remember this big hype around it and everyone saying how cool it was.  When we arrived we were standing on a beach there were a few Navy ships out to sea but relatively close to the land.  I looked away and when I looked back, a submarine had joined them and I had no idea where it had come from.  Then as it was getting dark, they put on loads of lights on the boats which lit them all up.  

I have no idea what it was all about or what was going on or why it would be done.  It must have been some kind of celebration but I remember it as being really cool.   I can't find anything about this anywhere and I'm even starting to wonder if I dreamed it.  Was it a thing? Anyone else know anything about it?"

Behold, air fryer chickpeas with chilli powder, garlic powder and Chinese style salt and pepper mix. Took around  minutes at °c to cook to a satisfactory crispiness using a little oil, shaking/mixing up every three-four minutes. The results were very satisfying, far more nutritious than crisps (protein, carbs and fibre among other things) at about - calories a tin factoring in the oil and spices and taste fantastic. Half of those later and felt very much satiated unlike with crisps where I could happily sit and eat  or more bags in a row (horrendous calorie count and not much useful nutrition - not to mention feeling crap about).

Those chickpeas are p a tin in ASDA. Great success I feel.

As a child and teenager, I'd hardly ever go into town centres because my life was basically home and school, and now I think I know that's why I was a bit happier. Town centres, at least mine, are almost third world with fuckwits who can't drive, people taking up the pavement or walking slowly, never making any effort to make way for you as you do for them (and that's if someone hasn't parked on the pavement) people spitting, coughing, sneezing, burping, farting left right and centre, rubbish all of the floor, people shoplifting or arguing with staff, every shop has a sign that says they'll prosecute and don't tolerate violence towards staff. I've often felt bad and as if I were imagining it or being unfair to expect better, but I don't think most people experience the horrors of the average town centre and I'd like to test that theory."

Together we can despair at the idiocy of the contestants that are desperately trying to impress an ageing Alan Sugar. 

Last year we saw Harpreet win investment in her desert shop thing - a business which she didn’t even wholly own! We on the sub universally agreed last years Apprentice series was probably the shittest thus far - so lets keep our fingers crossed for a better one this year shall we!

We’re starting out the series strong with a return of the “tour guide for an overseas adventure” task, over on the island of Antigua. Should be good!

[Here is a handy link]( to meet this years contestants. One of them is from Southampton so I automatically hate them, along with the accountant and the FC. Other observations are that there is a bloke called Simba which is a great name, and that I think Big Alan should be wary of the Ms Swindells in case she swindles him out of his cash!

So yeah. There we go. Another year, another Apprentice (surely Alan has no time to mentor all these apprentices of his no?). Lets see who’ll win shall we?

I wouldn't be as confused if the teabag sat in the sink whilst you washed your mug or made yourself another brew, but then took it out and put it in the bin before walking off. But that never happens, I always go to wash something in the sink and find a teabag just sitting there.

It came to a point where I was making myself anxious and depressed because of it. 
So recently I decided to take some refresher lessons and I must say that the instructor was amazing, he said to treat the lessons as if he was a mate and to just drive around casually and my god I'd forgotten how I could actually drive and pretty well at that. Shortly after these lessons I took the plunge and bought my first car, it's nothing special but its MINE and I've never had one before so I kind of love it. 
After buying it though I got back into my head and every time I looked out of my window at home I'd see this car not getting used and began to talk myself out of driving it. 
Anyway, I recently started taking short journies both on my own and with my wife and son in with me. 
Today I woke up for work and I drove myself in for the first time ever and I feel so proud of myself.

Things I'm looking for:

 Sturdy
 Budget: up to £

 Quiet or makes minimal noise
 Great after sales service and option to buy insurance / breakdown care. Argos offers [Breakdown Care]( for products purchased from them. If the retailer doesn't offer this, can I get this separately from an insurance company? The one with Argos is apparently through [Domestic &amp; General]( but I can't seem to find it. On their website, it says they provide cover for household appliances (washing machine, fridge, TV, etc). There's [Protectyourbubble]( for Amazon-bought products.

A couple of treadmills I'm considering:

 [Reebok One GTS Treadmill](  km/h, ⨯ cm, £ | insurance ✓
 [Viavito LunaRun Fold Flat Treadmill](  km/h, ⨯ cm, £ - % pre-assembled in the box | insurance ✓ | [review](
 [Reebok Jet x Treadmill](  km/h, ⨯ cm, £ | insurance ✓ | [review](
 [DOMYOS TC Treadmill](  km/h, ⨯ cm, £. - apparently uses a -pin plug (US) instead of a -pin one (UK) | insurance  

Which one should I choose? Any other models you can recommend?

So we lost our cat  years ago. She decided to go exploring during a flood and never came back. Thought she either got killed, or had gone off to die like cats do. Mourned her and moved on as you do.

Turns out she was living in a recycling centre for the last  years. The workers were looking after her. They just saw her and decided she was a stray. Never got her checked, and therefore she was never returned to us.

In September, she got ill. Yesterday they surrendered her to the RSPCA because they realised she wasn’t getting better. The RSPCA immediately took her to the vet. Vet scanned her and called us.

Truly one of the happiest moments of my life, arguably  years late, but still. But she was ill. Turns out too ill. Within the hour of finally getting her back in our lives, the vet told us we need to put her down. Kidneys completely shot.

Now I am forever grateful for the workers at the centre for looking after her as best they can. I cannot express enough how comforted I am to know she wasn’t alone. But if they just called the RSPCA in the first place, she could’ve been returned to us. The likelihood is that she wouldn’t have gotten ill. Or if she had, we would’ve taken her to the vet sooner.

I loved her so much. I’m grateful she returned to us in the end. And I’m happy she was happy these last  years. I’m devastated she is gone.

Please, please take any “oh I’m sure they’re a stray” cats to a vet. Or call a animal charity to get them for you (probably safer actually).

I have been living here since  and haven't found one. Have tried M&amp;S, Baxter's, Heinz, Free&amp;Easy, Suma, and Deliciously Ella brands. All were either flavorless, too thin, metallic, and/or just plain weird tasting. I like Amy's soups and my locals used to have some but they've all have stopped having them in the past couple years.

I used to often have a canned soup for a quick light lunch in the US and enjoyed Progresso, Campbell's, Wolfgang Puck soups-- honestly it would be rare for me to get a canned soup I didn't like! And there was such a big selection?

I'm a vegetarian so I usually go for a minestrone, lentil, tomato, any sort of grain/bean/veg combination.

Am I wrong? Do people think those brands are good? Is there no desire for better canned soup? Is it not culturally expected to have good canned soup options?

I've recently started a new job, and as part of that I'm away from home days at a time which is something ive never had before. When I'm home, I can easily eat healthy as I can shop for fresh ingredients and use my kitchen. However I've worked away for  days this week, and almost every meal has been just junk food and meal deals.

I'm sure there's an obvious answer, but whenever I buy take-away at home it's usually a treat so I don't consider healthy options, so this is a new way of looking at 'fast food' for me.

Would love to know what others do."

CasualUK,M Assaulted in my first month in the UK,"Male -  

So it's been one month since I moved to the UK from work (I'm Middle Eastern) and I did not expect that to happen on my first ever London pub visit.

I went to a local pub in Wandsworth just to have a pint by myself before meeting some friends. I was facetiming my family in front of the entrance, which happens to be the smoking area as well.

Suddenly I heard an old man (+) talking to me, which I initially regarded as friendly chatter. I'm generally very social so I smiled and was eager to pause facetiming just to have a chat with who I thought, was a nice old man until I heard ""Why the fuck are you standing here"" or something along the lines of that. I told him that I couldn't hear him (because I was on the phone) and he replied ""Are you fucking taking the piss out of me"" before spitting on the floor right in front of me.

There was a girl standing next to us who was utterly shocked, just as I was. She was very concerned and went inside just to inform security that he might do something to me. Don't know if I'll ever see that girl again, but I truly appreciated how much she cared - something that makes this whole situation a bit more easier to swallow.

I have no idea why he was acting very aggressive and I genuinely thought I did something wrong. I thought it could be against pub culture to facetime outside a pub. Curious to get anyone's thoughts on what I could have done wrong and why assault me out of  other guys standing in the smoking area?

Apologies if this is a rant - just genuinely surprised.

EDIT:
- I was using headphones
- I wasn’t blocking the entrance, though being drunk, he could have thought that which I understand.
- English is not my first language so assault might not be the right word. I get that. But it could have been way worse had I not backed off."

CasualUK,Us vs UK audience,
CasualUK,Today the kindest thing happened in Lidl of all places.,"So, I picked my  youngest, Max and Mouse, up from school and we needed to do a food shop so near their school is a Lidl.

We walked down and filled our big basket with all the ingredients for super cheesy mash and chicken on a stick (skewers). Because it was our time Friday... by which I mean that twice a month Grandma has some of the kids. She has my son one time and then my daughter and child another. It gives quality time for us both with them all.  of them have directly conflicting ND needs so this allows me to do stuff with them that the others areaverse to..., today was the Friday my son was with Grandma (my ex MIL is a damn Saint I tell you) and we were getting supplies for a fun night.

She got dinner ingredients, weekend food stuff. We got a big Key Lime Pie, their version of B and J ice cream and loads of fun foods for the evening.

When we got to the till, my card declined. I knew I had the funds so asked for a moment so I could log onto online banking and maybe send more money over to my main account.

That was the moment I realised my phone was dead. So I am there, at the till, knowing I absolutely have the funds for our shop but my card declining at every try and a dead phone. 

Most awkwardly, we also got a big bottle of their fresh OJ from the machine in the store that presses fresh.

So I reassure my kids that we will need to not get the shopping and will come back as soon as I have resolved the issue. Again, I had the funds, this was just a real awkward blooper.

A MANAGER came over because we had been a while and I was just apologising hard to the cashier and queue behind me and trying to my my kids not panic about the situ. I had already , as politely as a Brit gets in this situ, apologised to the cashier, said I need to resolve the issue and asked if it was OK to come back shortly and buy the goods.

The manager paid for your shopping.

He legit paid for our food. 

Now I am a known customer because the location is so convenient and we love to try new foods each week from their set range. But I don't know them at all. I was just caught up in a very unfortunate moment and tt
toring to find a way forward. I didn't ask anyone to pay for me and was set in my mind about a plan of action. I would charge my phone, get access to my online banking and complete the transaction.

And the manager just came along and helped me in a real moment of struggle as a parent.

On a cringe note, I cried. I am autistic so my emotions can get the better of me. 

We have spent the evening eating key lime pie and a great dinner, ice cream from the pot... and we have made thank you cards. In the morning we will deliver them alongside a box of milk tray. 

The kindness blew me away and I wanted to share the story.

I would love to get ideas for another thank you gift. Hes a lad in... i would day mid to late s. I am not overly flush atm so can't afford much as a spare but would love inspp on what else to get him.

My kids haven't stopped talking about how kind this was so as well as helping me, he has done them a social teach"

There was no knock at the door, nothing to indicate he was waiting, nothing until he had left with the bottles. 
Complained to Deliveroo who stated as the driver was not given ID he left and policy does not allow them to refund the order. Great.
Bottles are kept by the driver apparently, as the the shop had not had them returned. 
So if you do decide to order any decent booze or less perishable items, keep an eye on the app and make sure they aren't hiding down the road pretending to knock at your door.

Whether it’s somewhere in nature, a city centre or a residential road, we are surrounded by litter and in one way or another this is detrimental to us all. 

Picking up litter is so simple yet extremely rewarding. 

Whether it’s taking a bag to the beach or forest and collecting trash or simply picking up a piece or two and placing it in the closest bin in a city centre, we can all make a difference. 

This is both beneficial to us and the world around us, these small acts can inspire others to do the same, people who do litter may think twice about doing so in the future."

CasualUK,“Ghost” hunting,"Sister in law (brother’s wife) wanted to go ghost hunting for her th so a load of us went to a famous local castle last night from :-:. 

A “ghost hunter” gave us a brief history of the castle and the well known ghosts, gave us some rods to play with which apparently pick up yes/no answers and showed us his other ghost hunting equipment. 

My wife, mother in law, sister in law and most of the women there really believe in it all. The blokes there were a little more skeptical. 

The ghost hunter was able to get all his gizmos to light up and pick up “words” from the nearby ghosts via a “spirit box”. Basically a radio which produces white noise but is likely just very quickly switching between radio signals to pick up various clipped words (and music, a point I made several times) which are short and muffled enough to be heard as whatever you want to hear. This means it constantly changes from male to female voices (among the music) and it “talks” over you while you’re asking the questions. Because it’s a radio. 

Despite being told the time of day didn’t matter to the ghosts we had to turn the lights out in every room, allowing people’s imaginations to run away with them. Every tiny noise or light was the spirits apparently. When I turned my torch on I was asked to turn it off. He never explained why we had to be in the dark. 

Mysteriously enough, once we were split into groups none of the gizmos left with my group worked when he wasn’t there. At all. Except the spirit box which, after pushing the buttons we were told not to push, picked up a local radio station (specifically a Taylor Swift song). 

We joined the other group who were getting someone they all knew who had died through their spirit box. Cue about half an hour of the women “talking” to this ghost and saying how glad they were to talk to him, crying, and then panic as one of the words that was picked up sounded like “help”. Actual panic and tears. My wife was in floods at one point. 

After four hours the experience was over. My wife and her mother etc more convinced than ever they were right and talking about it all the way home. And my wife blaming me and my brother’s friends for laughing as the reason nothing happened when he wasn’t there. Despite her laughing with us. 

What a load of bollocks. Four hours in the cold dark, unable to see the historical relics etc because the bloody lights are turned off. £ each for the pleasure too. Finally got to bed after am, knackered, with the threat of having our kids returned to us the next morning hanging over me. 

I’m not saying I don’t believe in ghosts but I definitely don’t believe in any of that nonsense."
CasualUK,Traveling to England from the US,"Hello! I’ll be traveling to England next month and I’m looking for recommendations. What are some places and things I should definitely check out or do?

I’ve never gelled with the lifestyle here really, never felt the oomph to jog down the the pub every weekend.

CasualUK,CasualUK  Census - The Results!,"Hello!

Welcome to the results of the  CasualUK Census! In late November/early December we asked you to fill out the census so we can get a better idea of who subscribes to the sub, what they like and how we can make it better. Thank you for your comments in the [original thread](  – they will make sure that the census at the end of this year is even better.

A huge , of you filled it out which is quite frankly ludicrous. Over double the amount that participated in the  census. Thank you for taking the time to respond and for your thoughts on what you like about the subreddit!

Thank you as well to /u/My_Gap_Yah for analysing and visualising the data from the census - much appreciated.

Without further ado, here are the results:

Question  – [How are you today?](

Plenty of you were having a good day when you filled it out which is nice to see. To those who weren’t, I hope you’re doing well today!

That is unless you’re Finnish. [Of all the countries with more than one response]( Danish people were the most polite with % replying ‘fine, how are you?’ On the opposite end of the scale, only % of Finnish people asked how the census was doing. At least it is on brand.

Question  – [How old are you?](

Over half the people who filled out the census are  or under, though compared to last year there was a drop in the percentage of people in the - and - groups. Every other age grouping saw a higher percentage than last year’s census, so whilst the young ‘uns still make up the majority of people on the sub, the old folk are slowly taking over.

Question  – [Which gender best describes you?](

Two thirds of subscribers are male, though there was an upward trend in female users, increasing by %. Non-binary users dropped by roughly % from last year.

 odd people responded in what we’ll politely call nonsensical ways. These responses include:

-	A bag of chips
-	Barry, 
-	Colostomy bag
-	Intergalactic worm
-	Poo shaped rice crispy cake
-	Twink

There were also three people who identified as my mother and a bunch of people who need to get a new joke and stop identifying as helicopters.

Question  – [Is your gender the same as you were assigned at birth?](

Not a lot to say other than largely yes.

Question  – [Which ethnicity best describes you?](

Nearly % of respondents describe themselves as white British with a further % as ‘white – other’. Asian British and mixed ethnicity were the next highest.

Some people described their ethnicity as:

-	Amphibian
-	Carrot
-	Half orc
-	Pink with yellow spots (Cheers, Mr Blobby, nice to have you subscribing)
-	Six people who are apparently ethnically Yorkshire

Question  – [What sexual orientation best describes you?](

The percentages are roughly the same as last year’s census. One person described them as a Neymar Sexual, one said they have a thing for moderators and another is into really pirates (really into them. Worryingly so). 

Question  – [What is your relationship status?](

A third of respondents are single pringles and over % are currently in relationships. Well done you lot.

Quite a few people were mildly annoyed at being called pringles. To that I say: [take a look at this graph]( You’ll see what percentage of your age group is also a single pringle. Go find one of them and you’ll no longer be a pringle!

To the  people who are ‘complicated’, the one who’s relationship is ‘disintegrating’ and the person who dumped their boyfriend on a plane the day before filling out the census – I hope you’re doing alright.

Two top shaggers, fair play.

Question  – [What country do you live in?](

For this, we’ve removed the UK responses as % of people who took part were from the UK and removing them from the map made it more interesting. The link above is to a Google Sheets page with an interactive map so you can see how many people responded from various countries around the world.

Lots of increases in responses which you’d expect considering over twice the amount of people responded this year.  of you found the ‘I am not from earth’ option. 

The top ten countries in order were: the US, Canada, Germany, Australia, Netherlands, Ireland, France, Sweden, I am not from earth and Spain.

Please note that this is self reported so take it with a tiny pinch of salt. Not sure there's actually someone in North Korea reading CasualUK. 

Question  – [If you currently live in the UK, which county do you live in?](

Unfortunately, it was prohibitively expensive to purchase a map of the UK and then map the responses so you can have a graph instead.

Over % of respondents are based in Greater London, more than the next three areas of Greater Manchester, Hampshire and West Yorkshire combined. Happy to say South Yorkshire makes the top ten with one of us for each day of the year (unless it is a leap year).

Question  – [Are you employed?](

Almost % of people are in some form of employment, up % from last year which is good to see! There are % fewer students this year. Many of those students claimed that they were clean students which we all know is a lie. Get a shower, you dirty bastards.

The ‘other’ section includes people who are unemployed or are unable to work due to disability, illness or caring responsibilities. These categories will be included in next year’s census – thank you for your comments in the original thread highlighting this.

Question  – [What sector do you work in?](

Again, a few suggestions for things to include next year (e.g. rd sector/charity) which will be included. Over  people put that they would prefer not to answer so we’re going to assume that they are spies.

Question  – [Yeah, but what’s your job title mate?](

A word cloud! Aren’t we trendy? I am sure you’re all shocked by the prominence of ‘Software Engineer’.

If you’re interested, [here’s a link to the write in answers for job titles](  if you want to see the sort of daft things that some wrote in. It is in alphabetical order and is not linked to any other answers. Apparently my mum filled it out seven times!

Question  – [Have you changed job in ?](

Most people stayed put in their job over the past year, but about a third changed job. Happily most of those changed job for the better!

Question  – [Got any pets?](

As with last year, no pets is unfortunately top again. There are more cat owners than dog owners on the sub by a decent chunk it seems. That’s a shame.

Pig ownership has gone off a cliff –  pig owners last year down to ! What happened to all the pigs? Actually, don’t answer that. 

Lots of people putting houseplants down which last I checked are not animals. One person has a pet model railway, another left a packet of crisps on a windowsill for so long it has developed its own ecosystem. Plenty of people said some variation of ‘the other half’ LOL!

For those who have pet degus and tortoises please do share pictures on r/uk_pets, I would like to see.

Question  – [If you play games, let us know what you play on](

Unsurprisingly, PC came out way on top. Xbox seems to have significantly lost the console wars this generation, way behind PlayStation and Nintendo. Loads of mobile gamers – any recommendations?

 people still claim to play Atari. Who are you? Why? Move on, mate.

Question  – [If you like sports, let us know what you like](

Football is top of the pile, as always. Best sport, so that makes sense. Motorsport, including F, continues to be extremely popular, likely thanks to the popularity of Drive to Survive. In contrast, cricket is comparatively unpopular, probably because it is so rarely on free to air TV these days.

Lots of sports were suggested – Strongman, volleyball, skating, skiing, walking/hiking and something called ‘aerial hoop’.

Question  – [Will the England men’s team win the World Cup?](

Yeah, bit optimistic this one wasn’t it? There’s the Women’s World Cup this year to look forward to though!

To everyone who at some point said “I don’t like any sports, why isn’t there a don’t care option?” Neither of the last two questions were required answers so you didn’t have to answer, you muppets. That’s the don’t care option.

Question  – [Do you smoke?](

The percentage of smokers dropped a tiny bit from last year, but vapists increased by over % meaning that people who smoke in any form increased. Stressful year or ubiquity of disposable vapes? 

Question  – [Do you drink alcohol?](

Around % of respondents drink alcohol, pretty much exactly the same as last year. For those who do, what booze do you drink?

Question  – [If you do drink alcohol, what do you drink?](

Beer way out in front, followed by the usual suspects. It seemed like there were more people who complained about the spelling of whiskey than put tequila which is frankly insulting to tequila.

One person drinks sweat and tears, another is a fruit shoot fiend, and another drinks venom. Several people mentioned that they have reached milestones in their sobriety – congratulations!

Question  – [What hot drinks do you like?](

Coffee is closing the gap. For a nation of supposed tea fanatics, coffee is only .% behind in these results with hot chocolate not too far behind either! 

The mulled wine category includes all warmed alcohol including hot toddies.

One person made a point of saying they enjoy drinking warm sick. Yep.

Question  – [On a scale of -, how would you rate ?](

The average score was  and the most common score was  – both up on last year.  &gt; : confirmed!

Question  – [What was your favourite post on CasualUK this year?](

The above is a spreadsheet to all the responses for this question. Loads of good stuff mentioned.

As usual, many of the responses were either not from this year or not from CasualUK. The top response, [with over  mentions]( was the Jubilee chicken series. That happened on r/AskUK. Nice one.
Note to the mods – be better next year.

Questions  and  – Suggestions to the Mods and Thread Ideas

As always, we’re taking these questions away and seeing what is in them to improve the subreddit. We had thousands of write in responses so this will take a bit of time and we’re not in a position to mention anything just yet. I think this is a useful place to say that for every post of something you dislike, not only does someone else mention how they like those posts, but we probably remove and redirect - similar posts for every one we let through.

Thank you to the hundreds of kind comments about the subreddit, moderators and community. It is really appreciated. Over , people said some variation of “no,” thank you for your contribution. To the person who said we should do more censuseseses – no. They take bloody ages to analyse. Anyone who asked us to allow ducks is lucky the census was anonymous.

One person got extremely upset about being referred to as a nerd at some point in the census which is classic nerd behaviour if you ask me.

Some other suggestions to us mods:

-	ml tequila (your choice), ml Cointreau, ml squeezed lime juice, ml sugar syrup. Shake vigorously and serve over ice.
-	Brighton beach is better than Southend
-	Find an actual career (and many variations thereof)
-	i dont use reddit
-	Try a Nutella and wotsit sandwich, trust me on this, it bangs

Questions  – [What’s your favourite animal?](

Cats marginally beat out dogs, with otters ending up a respectable third. Quite the mix there isn’t there? 
[Here’s the full list of animals that people put down if you’re interested]( 

___

And that’s a wrap! Thank you for all the posts, comments and upvotes this past year, and thank you for filling out the census if you did. You’re a good bunch most of the time.

Here’s to a happy .

Let us know if you find anything fun in the spreadsheets in the comments!

CasualUK,Unnecessarily stopped in the road.,"Was driving in Newcastle for the first time. I was on the left lane driving towards a dual carriage way while the right lane was going towards a roundabout. At the right lane there was traffic lights for the roundabout which where red and had a arrow below them pointing towards my lane so I thought they where for me so I stopped and waited until seconds later I had multiple cars beeping at me so I started driving. 

Looking back at it it’s even more embarrassing, should of noticed there wasn’t a solid white line in my lane. I’m worried I’ll be reported, what would the penalty be for something like that?"

So CasualUK what local or regional cheeses can I include? Ideally something lesser known and that I can order online."

I've looked through their profile, plenty of feedback from sellers, but then I notice some of the feedback is written exactly the same from different sellers? Not all but enough to notice. Feedback such as ""Thank you for an easy, pleasent transaction. Excellent buyer A++++++."" Even down to the amount of +'s. Now maybe I'm being too paranoid but I guess my question is..

However I'm sure lots of parents call their children their baby even if they are grown ups? I'm not a parent but hopefully one day I will be and I would like to think my children will always be my babies no matter how old they are.

CasualUK,Does anyone else feel alone in the modern age?,"Let me explain. So, I was born in the 's and grew up as a kid during the late 's/early 's and obviously we had the internet back then but it was used more as a tool rather than a part of every day life.

Ever since around  onwards the world has just became chronically online and after the lockdowns in recent years I feel like it's even worse now trying to socailise with people.

I know it's ironic that I'm posting this online while complaining about us all being online but I can't help but long for the simpler days. I refuse to own a smart phone, I do have a laptop that I mainly use to write and record music but apart from Reddit and a few other sites, I'm barely active on social networking sites or online at all. 

I remember the excitement of going onto simple websites or MSN back in the earlier years of the internet but now it's just taken over everyone's lives. For example, every time I go outside and walk past someone % of the time they're staring at a phone screen.

Even going to gigs, I just live in the moment while everyone around me is watching on their phone. My missus will spend hours watching the same stupid  second Tiktoks or scrolling Instagram looking at food rather than watch a movie together. 

Even the joys of something as simple as going out to buy a movie or album are gone. Back in the day my friends and I would go to Virgin Megastore or HMV and spend ages in there looking for albums then we'd go and get food, go home and listen to them. We'd flip through the booklets, read the lyrics and all discuss what songs we did or didn't like, you know, we'd make a proper day out of it. Now it's a case of pressing a button to download, that's it. 

It makes me sad that there's a whole generation of kids now that don't know any better and will have lived their whole lives through tablet/phone screens. Sometimes I wish I could just get in a time machine and go back about  years. It's not even a case of seeing things through rose-tinted glasses, nostalgia or the fact I was younger, they just simply were better times."

CasualUK,How can I accurately pinpoint which neighbour is playing music all night?,"I live on the nd of  floors of flats,  flats on each floor,  doors grouped on each floor in a mini hallway, then a fire door out to a communal hall and stairs. I'm in the middle of the .

I initially thought it was upstairs neighbours as I've never heard a peep from either side of me in  years, sound tends to travel up and down rather than side to side.

Music has been going on for  months now, starts at pm just as I go to bed and prevents me from sleeping until //am unless I move to the sofa. Finally cracked last night and went upstairs through their fire door, so am stood in front of  flats doors and couldn't hear a peep so I bailed.

Back on my floor, in my mini hallway, I can hear the thumping, go inside and it stops until I get back to my bedroom. Pressed an ear against the wall to next door and I can feel it, but I'm still not convinced it's next door. It could be quiet upstairs in the hallway because I'd be separated from the music by  doors since their flat is a replica of mine and it's clearly coming from the bedroom area.

I just don't know which neighbour to ask. I don't know any of them so I don't want to go and complain at the first meeting and find it's the wrong one. I'm aware it could go badly anyway, you never know what type of neighbour you're going to get. Should I just leave a note downstairs by the letter boxes instead? I'm not sure what the best note would be.

Any help is appreciated."
CasualUK,What to do with parcels Evri dumped by my gateway?,"I ordered something on Ebay  months ago, Evri took a long time and just received it last week, not only was my parcel there but  other parcels belonging to other people, looking like they were just thrown over the gate, as if they couldn't be bothered or cared, most of them were neighbours, but  of them belong to some addresses  minutes to an hour drive from here all different postcodes and addresses. 

I live in a rural area, and finding addresses are quite difficult, but the names of the houses and farms are mostly on the gate entrance.

The postage labels are damaged on the three parcels, so it's difficult to see the tracking number.

I managed to contact Evri by their live chat service, sent a photo of all the parcels also the address on the box and the number of the van, they replied  days later and asked me for the full address and tracking number, saying that there is nothing on their database, tried to explain again, nobody ever answered back.

So not sure what to do with them, tried searching for the addresses online, nothing much there.
I did give the van number on my parcel which was the same as the others and also my tracking number for my parcel, incase they ask the driver and they might somehow remember, but that didn't seem to do much."

There is an arrow on the right hand side between ""LOW"" and ""NORMAL"", circled in red in the photo. I thought it represents the current rate, i.e. it would point to ""NORMAL"" in day time and ""LOW"" at night. I observed it switched from ""NORMAL"" to ""LOW"" at around :. It matched my expectation.

Not only are sockets safer, but every house in the UK has RCD breakers. Its just one more thing in the UK that is done just because it how it has always been done.

I found the band/song on Reddit somewhere and looked it up it on YouTube but unfortunately my history wasn’t turned on. 

I can’t go on with my life not knowing what this band are called or listening to that song I absolutely loved. I’ve spend about  hours searching but no luck unfortunately.

I’m counting on someone from CasualUK to put two and two together. I will love you FOREVER!

Edit: All of the words of the band title sort of roll off the tongue together, as if they rhyme in some way. The closest example I can think of is easee peasee squeezee. Sorry if I can’t be more specific!

CasualUK,"Why does the music video of ""Dreaming of You"" by The Coral only have  million views on Youtube?","I know it has tenfold that when it comes to listenings on Spotify, but it still kind of makes me think the song might be becoming slowly forgotten.

After all it's predates both Franz Ferdinand and Arctic Monkeys, and pretty much all of the indie bands  of the early-to-mid s indie wave. And to add, it was also used in a Scrubs episode (episode  of the second season) which usually gives some credence and additional views. And to add, their song ""Pass it On"" was used in episode  of the sixth season.

If you ask me, The Coral (and Dreaming of You more precisely) should really be seen as sort of the weird uncle that isn't all that much older than yourself, tying together the s indie with the  wave - and also the video itself is fine enough, perhaps a bit Madness-esque (I'm thinking of the stairway in One Step Beyond) - so why not?

I'm a bit befuddled.  million views I would have accepted, but a measly ten? The weird uncle deserves more. If you ask me, the song (even  years after I first heard it) is timeless."

I am trying to understand what the issue might be for such a high bill. I am thinking that perhaps I am on the wrong tarrif. I am on a deemed tarrif with EDF at .p/kwh and .p standing charge.

So you’d go to the serving counter and order your own choice from their set of items. Littlewoods, Debenhams, BHS all did it. I read this morning someone mentioning Woolworths cafes too.

You always get adverts right above each urinal. I mean, why not? It’s the perfect place, you’ve got a captive audience for + seconds (the plus getting more exaggerated with age, sorry chaps) as urinal etiquette dictates you keep eyes forward until you’re done.

What bugs me is that some of these adverts have QR codes on them.

I can’t be alone in thinking, that with all the unwritten rules of the gents toilet, that whipping your phone out and doing anything that requires the camera app is a colossal breach of the unwritten rules that will mark you as a psychopath and a social pariah. Am I overthinking this?

I've started mopping the ceilings...the condensation on them is worse than the windows so I do it every other day and it helps loads, especially when I add some damp killer to the mop, but I bet my neighbours think I'm crazy now. 

I never thought that at  I'd be staying home on weekends and mopping the ceilings, makes my life seem a bit sad.

Me: ""Ok, but her friends work in places like McDonald's""

""You can add a cover letter to explain this"".

""Ok, do I get a refund if it goes wrong?"".

""No"".

""And they have to know her for  years minimum?""

""Yes""

""But they don't, so what does she do?"".

""Try anyway"".

""And again...no refund?"".

""Yes, correct"".

CasualUK,"Ps help pls, my mum says no.","I have the cash(Not my true savings just my spending half), but my mum says no, she knows I have been saving up for years as well as encouraging it. As well as saying she would get me one for christmas but it has been  years. And now firmly denies me it, as well as forcing me to lend her cash to use as I am the only one who carries it. She has slowly started to repay me and has started doing it very slowly. I get s, s, and s at school and she has put me into tutoring, the only thing she lets me buy is books and the nat geo magazine( which I enjoy). My dad lets me buy games on my laptop (a  work laptop(dell) that runs on minimum graphics and still has  fps) and supports me in getting it, and he gave me cash as part of my Christmas present so that I can now also afford a £ game. But she still says no.

What do I do about this I want a console really badly that can play high-quality games(e.g spider man, god of war, etc..) I do have a switch but it doesn't charge properly and has really bad stick drift, but cannot access the same games.

Every time I bring it up she says I have no hobbies(i do), I need a better social life(I go out with friends every weekend, and we play proper games not just video games), and that I need to play an instrument(I am starting the piano), I'm not saying she is a bad mum by any chance, but she is being unfair with this, and I really want it. She says it will distract me from my revision (I have just started my GCSE courses and have been doing well, but it would make no difference as I play video games on my laptop.

Checked everything, pushing buttons, turning electrically hungry things like radio and heating off; display says “low battery % only  miles remaining” - maybe when it’s in low mode it won’t go?? Fiddle with a few more things, decide I don’t know what I am doing, best get back to the desk and admit defeat.

CasualUK,AITA? (UK Edition),"So this happened a while back as an Australian in London.

I was waiting in an orderly queue when some young French guys arrived, muttered something amongst themselves, then skipped ahead and placed themselves in the front of the queue.

Obviously none of us in the queue were particularly impressed, so I expected someone to say something. But instead, everyone voiced their frustration with ""Tsssssss"". Then big breathy ""Hhhhhhhh""s. Then people shook their heads. And rolled their eyes. And said Tsssss and Hhhhhh some more. But still noone said anything.

""Well someone needs to say something"" I thought to myself, so I stepped out of my spot, walked up to the guys, and said in my broad Australian accent: ""HEY FELLAS, BACK OF THE LINE"".

They gave me dirty looks, but sure enough, they left their spot and walked to the back of the line.

Now as I went back to my place I wasn't expecting applause or high fives, but I thought I'd get maybe a smile or a nod...

Noone made eye contact, noone even looked at me. 'This is weird' I thought to myself.

So I mentioned it later to an English mate. With much amusement he told me that the French guys were shitty, but that in fact I was the real villain of the piece. They were in the wrong, but then I shattered the social contract.

So were my actions acceptable and he was just fucking with me? Or am I a monster?"
CasualUK,"Fear of flying anxiety, anyone else &amp; what works for you?","I’ve got a pretty intense fear of flying, I’m  this year &amp; it’s honestly stopped me going to some great places, and the times I have flown it’s sort of hampered the experience with anxiety over the flight back.

I’ve looked at courses, read books, tried deep breathing &amp; unfortunately nothing works.  It’s an irrational fear, and I think my only fear in life.  

Is anyone in the same boat &amp; what’s worked for others?  I’m currently on a private medical page trying to get some sort of anxiety medication (Xanax, or another Benzo prescribed). 
 But hit a crossroad as they want to inform my GP, which I know makes sense but I don’t really want it on my medical record, as I fully know it’ll effect things down the line like even informing my insurance companies &amp; it’ll have me down as on anxiety meds.

What’s anyone else’s tip if they suffer, oh &amp; the reason I’m asking is my partners family for Christmas surprises everyone they are taking us away in a couple of months on holiday, including x  hour flights).

Except the character second from the right has been changed; it's Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster in the original but it sort of looks like Peter Sellers as Clouseau wearing shades in this version. I wasn't sure about Elvis neither.

So logically I would go to Superdrug to buy plasters, but also beside the plasters there were antiseptic wipes. So logically I would think you'd use the wipes on the wounds then put the plaster on, correct?

So I used it... Then I read the back...

""Do not use on damaged or inflamed skin or wounds""

Which I thought was strange because I thought this is what people use to clean wounds? And logically by it being right by the plasters this is what the purpose for it was?

[

The above is what I am talking about for reference (Superdrug), which also is placed in the first aid section of the site.

&amp;xB;

Is this a disclaimer companies use in the UK?

Do people in the UK actually use this and ignore the warning? Or do people not use it in first aid (at which point why is it there? What is it used for instead?)?

I am very confused and wondered if anyone else fell to the same conclusion I did?

I have been questioning this all day and cannot find a reason. xD"

CasualUK,"Himalayan Rock Salt Lamps, alternative medicine, and my moolah","I don't subscribe to ""alternative medicine"" - at least not that which has been heavily commercialised and which, in my opinion, stinks like a huge con designed solely to suck money from the pockets of people who are clearly needing legitimate assistance with legitimate conditions they legitimately suffer from. There's absolutely real and effective holistic stuff out there, but I struggle to filter out the crap.

As for the lamps, I just like how these things look, but all the supposed holistic health benefits that surround these things means I can't find anywhere sensible to buy a good, solid lamp, without the wall of faff thrown in my face about ions and allergies and electromagnetic radiation reduction...

I personally don't want to fund any groups or orgs that push shite products or beliefs, and that includes alternative medicine cons as they can be dangerous. I just want a well built, cool looking rock, that is orange and glows when I turn the light inside on. I don't want negative ions. I don't want pollutant absorption. I don't want overpriced shoddy shite that's going to fall apart when I put my book down slightly too heavily next to it.

If I had the money I'd start an online store of tested, solid products without any of the fluffy language, sold at a slight markup - it needs to be sustainable, of course.

&gt;Yes, it's a salt rock, but it's grown in a warehouse in Burton-On-Trent. Looks the same though, and it's well built! You can drop this thing and it won't break. Cool, huh? It glows orange when you turn the light on and comes with a (changeable!) w LED bulb that'll probably last you a good  years. Here's a few photos - no image editing. It's cm x cm x cm approx. £.

Are there any online stores like this or do I have another post-moass project to plan? Anyone know where I can buy one of these lamps without the crud?

Edit to add: 

TL;DR: rock salt lamp where. But for real, where are the honest, good online retailers? Is there like a curated list of them or something?"

CasualUK,"What can I do with a ""Patient hoist""?","TL:DR. I've got an electric hoist that can lift a human but I don't have any humans who need hoisting.  What can I use it for instead?

Full story:

I was at the tip a while ago and there was a thing that lifts patients into and out of bed. It's basically a remote controlled electric crane that can take kg load. It cost someone almost £ so he could help his dad. It got little use before his dad died. He tried to give it to hospitals/charities etc but they won't touch second hand equipment like this so he took it to the tip. It was headed for landfill but I couldn't be doing with that especially as one of my parents' neighbours had an elderly dad who couldn't get out of bed so I put some cash in their pot for Macmillan and they let me bring it home for him. I then offered it to them but they turned it down.   It turns out I didn't get the power cable to charge it up with but I think I can get one off Amazon. Now I have this thing that I need to find a use for so what original use can I put it to?  I've offered it about in case anyone else can use it for elderly/infirm patients but had no takers.

EDIT:  Many thanks for the replies.  I'm going to try a local mobility charity who renovate these things who might be able to use it for parts if nothing else as they're expensive - the battery alone is £!  If they don't want it, I'll try a few other charities.  If nothing else then yeah, a trebuchet draw mechanism would be awesome and, failing that, I'll look at sex swings but I'm still a bit wary about googling those and I'm not sure they're really my bag.

CasualUK,Looking for some 'old school' food recommendations,"Backstory: We moved to Australia like  years ago when i was a toddler, and Dad has only been back a couple of times. He's had a rough  months and I thought I might hunt down some Englandish snacks from the s and early s - but I have absolutely no idea what was in English supermarkets back then. The only thing I know (because we would sometimes get them as kids) are McVities biccies. I still like the occasional digestive or hob nob. 

Just hoping for a few recommendations so I can hop online and track something down, or even meals I could cook up. Will team it up with a full english brekkie for the old man.

I called straight away after ensuring I wasn’t being scammed, then subsequently was told after giving my correct name that “I am so sorry, this is not for you and is a mistake. Please ignore any texts, we won’t contact you again”

Since this, within minutes received an email from the same company using the same name (that isn’t mine).

About  ish months back, we were receiving letters for someone using the same name. They were from one of the train companies here in the UK, trying to collect a fine. I called them at the time, and told them that the person with that name doesn’t live here. They told me to just send letters back. I can only assume this is why these debt people have my mobile number? 

The train company subsequently sent me a few more letters, of which I all sent back as instructed with a “name not known at this address” note.

Could these two things be tied together?

Should I ignore the email? As I was told to ignore any communications from them - as it is a mistake!

We booked a stay on a houseboat, so we do not know the exact location of where we will be staying in London yet since it changes location.

That is why it would be nice with some flexibility and knowing whether it is possible to get off the bus before the final destination, Victoria. I can not find any answers on their webpage about it and have ever used their services before.

Do the buss drivers check your tickets when getting off the National Express busses? Or are you basically forced to wait until you reach the exact destination that is written on your tickets before getting off? :)"

CasualUK,Have you ever experienced the opposite of lucid dreaming?,"If lucid dreaming is waking up inside a dream and being aware you're dreaming, as well as being able to control that dream. I myself have been experiencing the exact opposite. I will be asleep, dreaming whatever thing it is I dream and then I'll wake up, the dream will be there in the waking world, I just continue the dream story, turn the pillow over or whatever it is I do, go back to sleep and the dream will have persisted. I love this, never had it before. Even if the period of being awake is a bit longer, the dream remains and I can just pick it back up. 

Does this sound familiar to any of you or am I even stranger than I thought?"

CasualUK,What is the most British thing ever?,"There is a lot of buzz around ChatGPT (text) and Midjourney (images) AI at the moment.

I asked ChatGPT ""What is the most British thing ever?""

It responded:

It's difficult to say what the most ""British"" thing ever is as it is subjective and can vary depending on who you ask. Some might argue that traditional British foods such as fish and chips or roast beef and Yorkshire pudding are quintessentially British. Others might argue that institutions like the monarchy or the Houses of Parliament are the most British things ever.

Some people might point to cultural icons such as the Beatles, Shakespeare, or James Bond as being the epitome of Britishness. Alternatively, certain customs, such as the practice of afternoon tea or the tradition of queuing, could also be considered very British. Sporting events like cricket, rugby or football might also be considered as part of British culture.

It is also worth mentioning that ""Britishness"" itself is a complex and multi-faceted concept that can be different for different communities within the country. For example, for some people in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, being British might be a different concept that it is for English people.

Overall, it's difficult to pinpoint one specific thing as the most ""British"" thing ever as there are so many different elements that make up British culture and what is considered quintessentially British can vary widely.

I asked Midjourney the same question. It responded with this:

CasualUK,Driving past horses,"I don’t know if this is the right sub for this but I feel like more people need to know how to correctly pass a horse on the roads, 

Firstly I’d like to say I’m not saying this is everyone but recently I’ve seen a huge increase in people who won’t even slow down for horses. 

I ride out on the roads on my horse, sometimes with a young girl and her pony and honestly I don’t feel safe doing so after my horse had to quite literally jump out the way of a van who was driving down the middle of the road coming towards me incredibly fast, made no attempt to slow down, despite me signalling for him to do so. 

Please if your driving out on roads and come across a horse and rider please slow down, at least to mph if not slower, and try and keep a  two meters distance, I know that on some narrow roads this isn’t possible, but where possible please do, especially if your in a large vehicle or have a trailer as horses can find these scary, we try not to ride on the roads as it’s not ideal however to get to bridleways ect it’s often necessary. 

I do everything I can to stay out of the way and make it easy for drivers, i wear enough hi vis to we seen from space and always try to get to the side and stop so drivers can pass, pulling over isn’t always possible so please don’t expect everyone on a horse to do so, some horses won’t stand in puddles/might see something scary and not want to stop or are being a bit naughty and refuse to stop. 

I can’t speak for all riders, but everyone I know does their absolute best to make it easy for drivers to pass safely, my horse is my most prized possession, please don’t be the reason I’m saying goodbye cause you where too impatient to wait."

Yesterday the company announced that they want everyone in  days a week from Feb and the decision has come from the CFO and CEO. Now my question is that are director and above level that out of touch or do they just not give a sh\t?

Working partly from home provides an amazing work-life balance being able to do daily chores and other things when you otherwise wouldnt be able to. Plus if you have kids, its a lifesaver.

CasualUK,Is This Some New Burglary Attempt?,"This happened to my boyfriend, but he doesn't use reddit..Basically, when he went out for the evening, he found  quid outside his front door (edit: not trapped under anything, wet, and apparently one had a worm on it). He figured he was just lucky and pocketed it, and I brought up a concern that his house was being cased. He said that that was highly unlikely, and went out for a few hours.

He returned home, and then about half an hour later (\~:), he got a knock on his door (he and I were on a phone call together). Some man that (according to my boyfriend) appeared homeless/ troubled asked my boyfriend if any money had blown into his yard, as that was his fare for some sort of public transportation (I didn't ask which). He's an honest person, so he gave him the  quid, and the man left shortly after.

I again brought up the idea that his house was being cased. My boyfriend reassured me that I was just overthinking it. However, I severely questioned why the guy would go to my boyfriend's house of all places, and check his house specifically for if his money had blown over there.. The  quid was also right in front of his front door, not near the ~~sidewalk~~ pavement or something, so I don't understand how it could have blown that far away, especially without the guy noticing. However, he insists that rubbish blows to that area often.

Anyway.. I can brush that off as a desperate man just wanting his money back. Maybe he went to all of the houses in the neighborhood before checking my boyfriend's house. I don't know.

But then, in the middle of the night, the man came back and knocked on my boyfriend's window (near the street). My boyfriend heard it, but ignored the man. The guy ended up leaving afterwards, and my boyfriend didn't sleep well last night because of it. However, he won't make any sort of mention of this to the police, despite my protests.

I'm convinced that the guy was trying to case out my boyfriend's house. What do you guys think? I'm scared for my boyfriend's safety, especially since I don't live anywhere near him.

Edit: the guy came back today. I’m currently getting details from my boyfriend.

Edit : from boyfriend, “He said he was a pikey and someone who he was doing work for didn't pay him and took his phone and wallet. I gave him £ [extra] and directions to the train station.”

the homeless guy referred to himself as a pikey."

CasualUK,HOW do people attend property viewings with a full-time job?!,"It’s virtually impossible in todays’ market to buy/rent a house, but feels equally impossible to even view them? 

Calling estate agents to book a viewing is easy enough, but they’ll ask if you can view the property in  minutes, at am on a weekday... although having a successful career (which is required to even get a fucking property!) means you can’t always drop everything and leave work every other day for several hours. 

So how are people doing it? The estate agents rarely want to re-arrange as the market is so competitive, they just apologise and say better luck next time. Taking time off isn’t always a good shout either, as often I’ve arrived at my viewing slot, the property has already gone and I’ll get an email about it right after I’ve left. 

Is this really only possible if you work from home, and can make up the hours in the evening? Anyone got any tips/advice, as I’m half tempted to just chuck in an offer if I like the photos these days…

CasualUK,What is the most impressive thing you have accidentally done?,"So I don't mean genuinely impressive things like passing  GCSEs with A\ or climbing Everest or learning Pi to  decimal places, but I mean those small things you did impulsively that momentarily impressed people.

I will give you my three examples:

. Years ago when I was about  I had just watched an episode of Happy Days (when it used to be on Channel  on a Friday evening), and walked over to turn the TV off and after doing so clicked my fingers Fonzie style.  
At exactly the same time I did that, by sheer coincidence, the curtain rail came out of the wall and the curtain fell down.
. When I was about / I was at school and, as it was pouring down with rain, no one had gone outside for lunch and everyone was just sat inside the sixth form block talking.  
I finished a bag of crips, screwed it up into a ball and then for some reason threw it up in the air with the intention of just kicking it up towards the ceiling.  
But instead the screwed up crisp packet came off of the side of my shoe, then curved about metres through the only gap in a packed room right into the bin in the corner.  
Because I was half decent footballer and played for the school football team everyone thought I had done it on purpose.
. A few years later I was at Uni and I shared a house with two other guys and two girls. One of the girls had a really attractive friend who often came round to ours to call on our housemate and the two of them would walk up to Uni together.  
This one day she came round a bit early and as I was making a cup of tea I asked her if she wanted one and she said yes.  
I put a mug down for her on one side of the kitchen and then walked over to the other side of the kitchen where the tea bags were and for some reason just threw it over my shoulder without looking.  
When I turned around I quickly scanned the kitchen floor but couldn't see the tea bag, then as I walked towards the cup I could see by luck the tea bag had sailed the  or  metres across the kitchen right into the cup. She was impressed, but I just nonchalantly shrugged it off.

Those have probably been the three highlights of my life so far."

Hmm, dumps stuff on side.. wait a min there's no pots in the sink, id left a very burnt frying pan there this morning. Walks upstairs suspiciousy.. curtains open, bed made. Ive either lost the plot or someone's come round, let themselves in, tidied and left.. I am truly baffled, just called my sister, shes not been round, besides she's in college all day and in what universe would she tidy my stuff. Okay. Has mum been round why the hell would she have been back, nope she's been at work since  and won't be home today anyway.
I think I'm going mad. Or this is some kind of wierd elaborate prank.

Edit: I HAVE ANSWER: It was my friend, he just rang me up cause he saw the post. He seemed to know more detail than I had posted... Eventually after laughing his face off at me he said ""Look in the fridge!"". There inside the fringe under a pack of spinach was my spare key, he then explained that when he'd got home  days ago he noticed an odd key in his jacket, turns out I'd accidentally left my key in his pocket when I borrowed it to nip back to mine in the rain a few days before, I'd then given him the coat back with the key accidentally included. He went round about  this morning thinking I was off shift and when he got no answer at the door instead of posting it like a normal person and leaving me a message he gained an urge to prank me, so he went in and thought what he could do to mess me in the head the most, and well yep, he also left a message on the home phone voicemail explaining which we listened to just haha. Honestly can't stop laughing though I've told him not to do that to me again !

He's definitely got a prank incoming from me in the not to distant future haha (I should add not to be mad at him about it, we prank eachother every so often, he definitely won this time though in an upsidedown way so did I, said he wished he hadn't started scrubbing my carbonised eggs and bacon off the pan, and mentioned he knew from the incident of the fiery cake that I was bad at cooking but thought I would have improved maybe slightly in the  years since then, it was a good sandwich though and as bonus I didn't have to wash up."

CasualUK,Running low on butter?,"I toasted two rounds of bread today, but when I got the butter out I realised that I only had enough to cover one round. What would you guys do in this scenario? Butter one round and eat the other dry, safe in the knowledge that you had at least one incredibly satisfying round of toast, or try to spread the butter equally between the two and end up being slightly disappointed by both, but thankful that you don't have to choke down a dry piece of toast. 

I was too lazy to go to the shop to buy more butter, and my toast would have gone cold by then. I opted to eat one dry, which was a thoroughly unpleasant experience. For those who would do the same, which do you eat first?

Edit - a few of you have suggested using peanut butter or jam, sadly I don't have any in. Perhaps I should have used beans for the other one. But can you have beans on unbuttered toast? It doesn't sound very nice."

CasualUK,Is it acceptable to not replace a missing fence panel in this weather?,"A fence panel form our fence that joins with our neighbour's garden collapsed yesterday leaving a big gap between our two gardens. I promised that we would sort it out today. Next door spend a lot of time in their garden, have a young grandchild over quite a lot and really value their privacy (aka not interacting with us unless absolutely necessary), so I feel quite bad that this has happened. 

The fence panels arrived today (we've said we'll replace the whole fence when we can as it's all on its last legs) but between struggling to physically lift it high enough to slide into the concrete posts, unsteady ladders and the panel billowing about like a sail in these winds and rain, me and my partner didn't manage to get the  new panel in to fill the gap. 

I feel quite defeated. My partner insists that it's understandable that we haven't managed it in this weather,  that it's unsafe to keep trying and that next door will understand. I worry that everyone else on the planet would have managed it and that next door are going to be wondering why there's still a bit gap between our gardens.

My question is, would you lot on here have got it done, or is it acceptable that we gave up and said we'll try again when the weather is better?"

I know that they had hits in the s and afterwards, and in fact they are still going,  years after they formed (albeit with a different lineup)!

I responded with ""did you know that every verse  in  seconds to go by so solid crew is, infact,  seconds long"" so now everytime I go in I have to give a fact.

CasualUK,Inside the mind of a conspiracy theorist,"There's a barbershop literally at the end of my road, just a few metres from my house, which is dead convenient and the owner does good work.

She's a nice enough young woman, if a little dim. I knew she was an anti-vaxer based on comments she'd previously made and she's said a lot of stupid stuff over the years (e.g. her being confused how Google could bring up pictures of aliens if nobody knows if they're real / has seen an alien, I pointed out these are likely drawings or mocked up photos she's seen based on what people think aliens may look like / claim to have seen).

Tonight though she really let loose with her current theories, all of which are borrowed from others and none of which she truly understands.

She was complaining about her FB page being taken down again, she doesn't understand why. Then she said it's just like Joe Rogan says, something about first they take down your social media, then they arrest you, then they kill you. I asked if she really listened to Joe Rogan, she back pedalled a bit and said she only listens if she likes the guest he has on. I said at least he's not as bad as Andrew Tate and then she immediately jumped to his defence - he's completely innocent. I asked about the alleged sex trafficking and alleged rape etc (I've seen a recording or something floating around of him apparently admitting to rape), she had no idea what I was talking about. So he's totally innocent BUT she has no idea what he's been accused of. Also he's right about his views on women apparently, and she wishes she could be more like what he wants because then she wouldn't be single. And her FB page being removed is EXACTLY like what is currently happening to Tate.

She then went on about how he must be anti-sex trafficking because he's friends with some anti-sex trafficking Christian rapper and an American politician who she donates money to. I dread to think. It was content from that politician which she said caused her FB account to be closed after she shared it.

Then she got onto Kanye and how he doesn't deserve what's happening to him, again she had no idea about the things he's actually said / done, including his love of Hitler and blatant anti-Semitism. Then things got even weirder as she went on a rant about how all the rich people are Jews and she doesn't know why, perhaps they don't spend any money. Then she said the queen was Jewish. 

I realised she was confusing being Jewish with being German, I explained the UK royal family does have German ancestry and she admitted she didn't know what a Jew was. Then she went on about how Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad was Hitler's right hand man and killed so many that he got the name The Terminator which is why people call Arnold The Terminator now. I tried to explain about how James Cameron had written The Terminator before he even met Schwarzenegger, and it was because of the film that he got that name, and that Arnold's dad was an Austrian policeman who happened to be in the Nazi party (as far as I know). 

But she kept going on about how that was what she'd read. The classic ""I've done my own research"" came out once or twice throughout. She must be right because there was a photo of Hitler with Arnold's dad that she'd seen (I've since done a quick Google, I'm shocked to say I can find no such photo).

Getting your haircut can be awkward at the best of times due to small talk with your barber but she spent long periods ranting on while I stared off into the distance like Rich Evans. I tried to correct her where I could but I couldn't access my phone to quickly show her why she was wrong and I didn't want to get too drawn in. I thanked her and left, wondering if the convenience is worth the mind numbing conversation.

TLDR - my barber is a nut"

CasualUK,New house new neighbours,"Hi me and my family have recently moved into a new home. We have nice neighbours but their dryer is right against our shared wall. It's on day and night and causes a terrible sound and very uncomfortable vibrations right through the house. 

I've yet to say anything because I was hoping you lovely people could give me ideas?
All I've got so far is obviously knocking on and explaining the situation but should I buy a soundproofing mat for them to put under as a suggestion. Do you think this would be well received.  I really don't want to cause inconvenience to them but at the same time it's just not nice having that constantly going. 

Thanks everyone"
CasualUK,Do you have a jar of old screws?,"I was talking to a colleague, he's , owns his own house, reasonable wage. I don't remember how the conversation came about, but I said ""oh, everyone's got a jar of old screws they've saved 'just in case' they need one"" and he looked at me blankly.

CasualUK,Is Doctor Who a children’s TV show?,"I have watched the show in the past and I always considered it a show that is for everyone, I suppose a family show if that’s a thing. However, I’ve seen a lot of people reference it as a children’s show. For me a children’s show is something that is aimed solely for children or at least their main audience is children, and showed on channels like CBBC. This doesn’t feel the case to me for Doctor Who, other than the spin offs that were shown on children’s tv (such as Sarah Jane Adventures). Anyway, there’s no real reason for this post I’m just interested to know what most people think."

CasualUK,The UK's worst stretches of road,"With all the doom and gloom around at the moment, I've not seen any discussion of what is clearly the UK's biggest issue at the moment, which is small stretches of road that you hate driving down for totally banal reasons.

So thought I'd start with my top (bottom) . Final winning road get's dug up and replaced with a landfill.

. A between Derby and Stoke, specifically the stretch going past Uttoxeter. Let's build a bypass to get toward the M, but let's build it from noisy concrete, put roundabouts all the way through it and then outside Uttoxeter, let's put a pedestrian crossing in so people don't get squashed going to the McDonald's. How about building slip roads and overpasses, nope far too sensible/expensive.

. A through Coalville. Roundabout after roundabout, matched to NW Leicestershire splitting lanes toward roundabouts to one for straight on and left and one for right only. Do you take a chance on whizzing down the right to either cut in or come around the roundabout? Good fucking luck, you'll end up looking like the griswalds stuck going past the Houses of Parliament all day

. Kingsbury and Tyburn Road toward Birmingham. This stretch of road was clearly designed by someone off their face on crack. Every junction has a different set of rules. Lane  merges into lane  then next lane  merges into lane . Then lane  looks like it's only for turning left as it splits off from the main road, then merges back into lane . Matched with Birminghams legendary all day traffic and the regions distaste for sign posts makes it a royal pain in the arse

. The M. Constructed almost totally from Concrete, chosen I think to be as loud as possible. After miles of ear piercing noise, you finally think you've reached respite when you get onto asphalt roads again, only to realise you're not in Grimsby and things are about to get a lot worse

. The A between J of the M and Mansfield. Seems to consist of constant m stretches of  or  lane road, that then expand by one lane at traffic lights before reducing in lanes after the lights, meaning every five minutes it's like the start of a Grand Prix to get away and in front of the car ahead of you, except without exception you are always stuck behind someone who requires written permission from the reigning monarch before they engage first gear at a set of traffic lights"

CasualUK,Is it a British cultural thing to not use the doorbell?,"I was really excited when we (my partner and I) were renovating because we could get doorbells. Two: because of the design of the terrace house - the front is accessed by a path (often used by the postman and locals), and the back (is accessed by deliveries and all but the most lost takeaways). Both entrances are accessed by porches. Each of the doorbells is set up to have a unique chime. 

We have the doorbells for good reasons. We write “please use the doorbell” in the delivery instructions whenever offered the option when ordering things - we appreciate that maybe this message won’t have been passed on.

Yet only about % of people bother to use the doorbell. People will leave having not tried the doorbell. 

The more ridiculous example of this is this: I get my medication delivered (controlled medication must be handed to a person). I sit and wait from the start of the delivery time, the guy every week posts a missed you note through the door which I notice when I let the dogs out. I call for him to redeliver. When he comes back he uses the bell. Same guy every week.

I know I could put a sign on the door, I don’t particularly want to. I just didn’t know this was a thing till I got a doorbell (or two)."

CasualUK,"I'm turning  this August and I guess I haven't had an amazing social life whilst being an adult and I feel like by the time I FINALLY complete my undergraduate degree, I want to enjoy the fruits of social life. Please ready a brief story below.","So back in September I enrolled on a nd year at a non-Russell Group university just to have a simpler workload and be better supported than I did at the other RG university I failed twice at.

Only back in November  I found out that I had dyslexia which sucked hard because had I known I had learning difficulties I would have had been a better position to enter the RG university I was attending.

I'm a fighter who wants to achieve the best possible, but knowing that I didn't have much of a student life in terms of extracurricular and active social life has been damning.

I feel at , time is only running fast and there is not much time to gain a greater social life.  feels like such a daunting age to reach.

Is it worth me gearing towards maybe a part-time degree to work full time alongside it?

All thoughts welcome."
CasualUK,CBBC(?) Show about video games?,"I randomly remembered a show today that maybe used to be on CBBC or C or something.. I’m gonna guess like close to  years ago, where there were two male presenters and they were talking about new video games, showing gameplay, walking round a studio with kids playing different games (almost like an arcade kinda set up unless I’m misremembering). Centrally there were two kids going head to head on a new game and they had the duration of the show to practice it, then go head to head at the end. I remembered the show because I was reminded of SSX Tricky and that was definitely one of the head to head games. This was PS/XBox early days. Does anyone remember this/what it was called??

So why would he not accept the caretaker manager position? He clearly wasn't fulfilled in his current position at Wernham Hogg, is it because he disliked working there in general and didn't want to put himself in a position that'd force him to stay?

Helping my brother pack up his kitchen for a house moved and was appalled at his toaster etiquette. I think to myself that he must have the wherewithal to empty the crumb tray before he packs it. I am a toast enjoyer and a fastidious tray emptier. If you move my toaster from one counter to another, not one crumb shall fall. Surely others care about this routine task. Surely he does not intend to move the crumbs to his new abode.

Not only did he not empty the crumb tray before before packing it in a box with other items, he confessed that he has never emptied the crumb tray in his + years of owning it. What happens to the crumbs, I ask? Do you not have crumbs? Yes, he responds, shamed, I just wipe them onto the floor and let the hoover get them. 

I’m shocked. We come from the same womb, we share the same DNA, we were raised in a stable home by loving parents. Yet clearly at some point he decided to take a different path to me. He was always quiet, slightly odd, but I genuinely never saw this coming."

I went to their website with a lovely menu and easy options to pay by card before going out to collect, after being told the (pretty big) celebratory order was through and would be ready in twenty minutes. The receipt came to my email address and to my horror it turned out to be an identical restaurant name nearly  miles away. Sheepishly confessed to partner (after I'd used his card, the horror!) what I'd done and had to get on the phone to plead my case to the Chinese restaurant. Turns out they didn't do refunds or very much at all as the food I'd ordered was coming from elsewhere; I'd have to ring their courier number to cancel the order and get the money refunded. I then spent a horrible birthday evening on the phone to various third party delivery and catering companies, including the card company, trying to cancel everything. 


Obviously my own stupid fault for assuming the automatic address that came up in Google was the right collection point without checking the Maps function.

CasualUK,Old knee injury has started to hurt again. What can I do?,"Back in , the age of ,  I dislocated my knee and tore both ACL and meniscus playing football. At the time, my Mum decided against me getting surgery, despite Doctor's advising her that I should go through it and then blamed the injury on me being a chubby kid playing football. 

As a result, I never got treated, my injury became a chronic injury as a result and since then I have to be extremely careful when walking so as to not dislocate my knee and make it worse. I also developed Osteoarthritis (currently not treated and not formally diagnosed here, but overseas). 

I went to the gym on Friday and since then, my knee has started to hurt nonstop, even when sitting/sleeping. I can walk on it but it is painful and there is definitely some swelling there. 

I currently work in the NHS and know firsthand how stretched thin A&amp;Es are across the country and how bad it is. I don't want to take resources away from anyone and have also been dismissed and left waiting hours to see someone, even though I have had MRI &amp; CT scans outside and at least  in the UK, confirming my injury. I can walk without crutches but have a (poorly fitting) knee brace I can wear.

So my options are as follows:

- Do nothing and wait until it goes away on its own, potentially making my injury worse
- Go to my local Boots or pharmacy to pick some Voltadol, which is a temporary relief
- Call my GP tomorrow and wait potentially two weeks to see someone
- Go A&amp;E and wait hours just to be discharged home after a XRay
- Pay out of pocket for a private referral to a Trauma doctor, which can set me back s or even k+"

I can't stand it. It constantly gets in the way, blocks the door, requires removal and replacement every time someone comes and goes etc. I'm desperate to bin it and maintain that it's basically doing nothing anyway so what's the point. 

She won't hear a word of it and insists that it's useful and we need it.

A few things to note:

 - This is an internal front door - there is a sealed pvc porch on the other side of it, so I'm not sure what 'draft' she's thinking this excludes.

 - The door is ancient, single glazed with gaps all around and a window pane that was once removed and poorly replaced, so blocking draft along only the bottom is like putting your finger over  hole in a colander and calling it a bucket.

 - The house in general is really poorly sealed. Our back door is in the lounge and is pretty poorly sealed, as are a lot of windows so I struggle to see what difference this makes.

Down the road from me is a small park with trails. I walk around these a lot and there are a lot of dog walkers that do the same. On one part of this trail, there's a load of glass of various colours, like old milk bottles, beer and wine bottles etc that's off the side of the path, I can't see any that's smashed they just seem to be empty bottles. There are also some that are plonked on the end of tree branches. 

Now my original thought is this is some lazy git dumping it there for some reason, but a couple of years ago the council (I presume it was them) put up an official looking sign warning people that there is glass on the path. I thought this was odd as if they had the resources and knowledge to put the sign up, why didn't they just clear the glass? 

My only other thought is that there is a shit tonne of badgers that live around there, and one of the paths is actually closed at the moment because of all the sets that have been dug underneath. Is the glass there to stop the badgers digging? 

Thanks to anyone who can help end my pondering."

CasualUK,"Has anyone else noticed that ""mild"" cheddar in the supermarkets doesn't melt properly any more?","I always swear by mature cheddar for cold applications (sandwiches, basically) and mild cheddar for anything melty; cheese on toast, toasties, grilled cheese, baked potato... whatever. But... recently all the supermarket ""mild"" cheddar I've tried (which I'm assuming is all made in the same factory) is now weird and chewy when melted? Like, a sad, solid layer of dry chewy disappointment that falls off the toast rather than a warm gooey flowing puddle of lovely melty cheese that I've been used to in the past.

I'm not talking about the ""value"" mild cheese either, that was always an awful non-melty disappointment. Just the normal, non-value, standard own brand slabs of cheese in the colour coded packets.

I've tried Morrisons, Aldi and Sainsbury's at this point and they're all the same. 

Is this just me or has anyone else noticed the same?

They had a sales guy who was terrible and was berated every episode. The only thing I remember about him was that he was a competitive Othello player.

If you've never seen it this description sounds crazy but I'm sure it exists. Can anyone remember and help me find this?

Edit: Thank you to everyone that replied. It's called The Armstrongs. I have watched the first two episodes on Youtube and it's amazingly terrible. I'd recommend everyone watch it."

CasualUK,"Not uk specific, but I’m in the uk so wanted to know if there’s any like minded souls","I work retail, have done for over twenty years. I imagine the customers see us working as they come in and think about the staff as “he’s working today,or, oh she’s in” but a lot do actually speak to me as a friend.
Regardless of how they see me, none of them actually realise how I see them! The girl I used to sell sweeties to is bringing her little one in now, so I can sell them sweeties! 
Many customers have passed that I still think of, many new customers come in too. 
The life of a retail worker is busy and chaotic, but when it comes to regular customers, just know we are watching you grow. We aren’t family but we see you. And if you never speak to your local retail assistant and now realise you don’t speak to anybody really, and that gives you that hollow ache in your chest, next time you’re in, talk to us. 

We lost a customer last week that never spoke to us, we learned they had no family. Maybe we should have done more, maybe they could have."
CasualUK,Great life lessons from your awesome parents?,"NGL I had a very happy upbringing but was expected to work hard. I got my first job as a KP when I was , later l waitressed and then bartendered after . I worked hard at school at the same time, so I also was allowed some freedom within reason. My parents both worked full-time demanding jobs and were tired at weekends.

When I was  I started going out clubbing after my Saturday night shift and crawling home about am. I was convinced I was SILENT.

Apparently not... after a few weeks I woke up at am on the Sunday morning (parents were default early risers- that was a massive lie in for them) with an am start at work for me. The hoover was going - AND my favourite Manic Street Preachers album ""Gold Against The Soul"" was playing so loud I could hear it from downstairs in perfect detail over the hoover!

(I have never had a problem with getting up early, but I have always timed my alarm to the minute to ensure that I am up, ready and on time for whatever, and if you wake me a MOMENT earlier I'm a psycho)

I marched downstairs and DEMANDED to to know what the hell my mum was doing!

""Darling, I just needed to hoover, like you needed to half-wash the dishes a few hours ago, breaking a plate and leaving it in the water. And I LOVE THIS MUSIC! So do you! Which is why I didn't stop you playing it after you got in. Is it a bit loud?""

I now work shifts and roll in at all times; I still hate being woken earlier than I need to be, but I hope I am a more considerate person and absolutely creep around the house so as not to wake my boyfriend!"

CasualUK,WFH + Travelling while employed in UK,"I tried to search to see if there's any similar post but can't find one. Apologies if there's already one though.

&amp;xB;

Are there anyone here who are experienced in travelling around while working remotely? I.e. officially you're working from home, but actually you are travelling outside of UK while you're working.

&amp;xB;

I only just remembered this is possible at my current role since I fully WFH (I read there are people started doing this back in late ), at the same time I'm applying for jobs which none of them are fully WFH. In the end I think to myself I do want to travel more. And I think I currently have a friend or a family whom I can rent a room with, and then maybe I can travel abroad maybe up to a month at a time while ""WFH"". My plan is to keep the same hour just adjust to local time while working abroad. I.e. if I travelled to Syndey, I work in local time like :-: which is the equivalent of : - : in London UK.

&amp;xB;

Can anyone advise me what to look out for whether it is UK general employment policy about this, or pay tax or something while being abroad? (I'm aware of make sure I get the right visa though.) Are there anything else I need to be exceptionally careful of? (I'm also contacting my local HR to check if there's anything I need to be aware of first, before discussing further with my manager about this. He is already somewhat aware of my planning and he's a chill guy. But once I made further decisions I think I will let him know the full details.)

I'm assuming this comes from historical times where you kept your dominant right arm on the outside, incase of joust or other such attack. Now, I understand that some people might favour their left arm and therefore feel the need to walk clockwise, but surely that's around only % of people and if my maths were correct this lunchtime, there were far more than % going the wrong way.

And runners? Surely, surely, you must run anti-clockwise around the pond as that follows the same direction as a running track.

CasualUK,Things since  that have made you proud to be British,
CasualUK,My fuel bill for December is £,Feeling a bit shocked to be honest. Had the family staying for a few days over Christmas so guess it was going to be high but over £!? That’s just mental. Normally there’s only two of us here - although we both work from home. But we use log burners in the evenings and weekends so thought that would keep costs down a bit. Clearly not. What is everyone else’s looking like?
CasualUK,Is it me or are spoons getting stingy when it comes to chips?,
CasualUK,Fish and Chip shops where you live,"Would love an idea about what you can get in them, and work out the different regional varieties on offer.  Just your standard down the road chippy.

For example by us you can get potato fritters which are slices of potato fried.    Haddock or cod, plus roe, mushy peas, gravy, I saw pickled onions, not eggs though, not pineapple rings.

Plastic forks but am sure it used to be wooden ones   

Hull did patties, basically herb mash potato battered, plus battered peas and also chip spice which is basically dried paprika powder.  

Portsmouth seemed to be very conservative, I expected more fish variety but there was only cod and haddock, possibly roe.  Mushy peas but none of the southerners were having any of that northern nonsense!

Take a photo of your menu and post it so we can see what diversity we have in our national dish!"
CasualUK,TIL Jeremy Paxman has already recorded his last episode of University Challenge. And to be honest I'm a bit sad about it,"Look, I know it's just a quiz show but he's been doing it since I was a teenager and it's one of those constants that you don't think will ever change. 

I know he has parkinson's and that has been evident in his speech over the last couple of series. I was thinking to myself over Christmas how much I enjoyed the Christmas special tournaments, how I'm already looking forward to the next season, and how it'll be a sad day when he decides to give it up. And tonight I found out that he already has. 

Damn."

Right now I've woken up with a searing pain in my teeth/jaw and I'm unable to go back to sleep - I don't know what to do to get help, my anxiety is going mental and there's no way I can go into work with what feel like daggers in my skull.

I don't know what to do, I'm halfway to calling , but I don't know what they can do for me at this time of night. I don't think I'll be able to get back to sleep.

Sorry if this is daft but I'm in a lot of distress and I don't know what to do

Update - :: Called , very nice and calming, they've passed my details on to another local service who should call within the hour.

Update - :: Looks like I'll have to call up a local dentist and ask for an emergency appointment in the morning. Wish me luck x

Update - Wednesday: I got an emergency appointment for Monday, thank you x"

Appeared to be shortband, high intensity (obviously) frequency unknown.  
Was picked up through my stereo system, a friend showed up as the noise sounded again, so I can verify that it was indeed picked up somehow like stray walkie talkie frequencies sometimes are.  


Highly unusual for the area.  
Did anyone else hear it too?

Quite unsettling given the intensity and I cannot find anything regarding it online or in news. Will be asking about the area to see if anyone else heard it too.

CasualUK,Children and social media,"In reference to the Online Safety Bill, I have some questions regarding children's use of social media
. what are the positives of children using social media?
. why do parents allow children to use social media (and even have a phone)?
I do not have children and people tell me that their kids would get bullied if they didn't have a phone but why let the children have control when the simple answer to stop harm/depression is to not allow access? 
It seems the kids get bullied either way.."

Anyway, he did his plops, wiped his bum, got up, flushed the toilet. And I heard him pull his trousers up and seemed ready to leave.
But no, then he lifts the toilet seat up, opens his zipper and does a wee???!!!

Surely this isn't normal behaviour?? You'd do them both at the same time? If anything, I've sometimes sat down for a ""luxury wee"" but upgraded to a poo.

I was wondering if it's possible to get a clinical test in some private clinic (h. pylori breathing test) without first needing to go to the GP or other doctor for a referral. 

It's a non-dangerous test, but regardless of that, private clinics I contacted all said that referral is needed before doing it. I was wondering if some private clinics exist which don't require this? 

I'm a student in the UK and I'm a surprised by this as in my country of origin, you can do such routine tests in a private clinic without needing to consult a doctor beforehand. If you go via NHS than referral is a must."

Rang the intercom outside the office block for their floor… no bloody answer! Waited.. nope no answer. Called them… no answer! So I guess moral of the story is that if you think there’s no point going to an interview - don’t! 

However…. The PM interview - genuinely couldn’t have went better. Company seems great and I’m actually super excited about that one! 


I’ve started looking for a full time role after a few years out of traditional working - found a few sales positions and got a few interviews lined up. 

After looking through the Google reviews for a company I’m due to interview with in the AM - well the reviews are shocking.  and basically it’s clearly a total rip off. We’re talking all the  are clearly fake and the rest are  with very thorough detailed explanations of what’s gone wrong. Even the company responses are rude and just absolutely diabolical tbh. As such, I have no interest in working there anymore. 

However - I have another interview booked in for the PM tomorrow and I am % sure they will mention my morning interview as to how it went, albeit probably briefly. 

Do I just go to the morning one so I can answer honestly about how it went (I don’t like to lie - as I know it would probably seem easy enough to just say it went fine even if I don’t go but it doesn’t feel right) ?

Or do I cancel the AM one and be honest about why I didn’t go to the PM one?

I just don’t want to make myself look bad to the PM interviewer as I’m actually pretty interested in that role. And the PM had originally asked for a morning interview but I’d rejected on basis I already had one lined up with the company I now no longer wish to attend.

Sorry if it’s a bit waffly!! But any advice on it welcome, thanks"

I read it and was happy to see that no characters ended up getting physically assaulted by an adult which, if I remember correctly, used to happen to pretty much all characters every week.  Dennis the Menace was probably the prime recipient of a weekly whacking back in the day.  Minnie the Minx used to get them a lot. The Bash Street kids' teacher used to cane them.  Billie Wizz used to get whacked weekly for going too fast.  It was so common to get a beating that nobody batted an eyelid and kids used to write in with suggestions for ""Whack Proof Trousers"" so their shenanigans could continue as the effects of beatings were mitigated.  It clearly had an effect on me because all the dads in that comic had moustaches and I still see taches as a sign of fiery-tempered weakness.  Am I remembering it all correctly?  And when did The Beano decide to put an end to the whackings (which I'm glad they did)?"

CasualUK,Motorbike Collision Leads To A Broken Arm | Casualty /,
CasualUK,"Parents want to sell their house to us cheap, but want to live in the annex for free. Should I?","My in-laws are moving house because my FIL has dementia and they need the money. They really do not want to move, but they have to. 

They have come to us and asked if we would like to buy the house at % value (£k) with the condition that they can live in the annex rent free basically until they die… which could be  years. 

The house is huge and we would be happy to upsize and renovate the house, but can I stand living next door to my in-laws?

We have  young children so the help with childcare would be welcome but we would be moving further away from my parents, which I’m sure they would feel hard done by and basically re-living my in-laws lives over again. 

It seems a tough move because we love where we live but the financial implications look great. 

Anyone done it or have an opinion/advice?

EDIT: 
Thanks for the advice so far. FIL has early onset dementia so he is still very happy and able but there is a chance he could decline very quickly. But who knows. 
I think the sticking point for me is that they want to live next door until they die. Do I want to commit to living in that house for  years, just for the equity? I do love them but it’s a big change, and ask on me and my family.

UPDATE:
Many thanks for all replies, from all viewpoints. We have come to the decision to decline the offer and stay where we are. The care implications and resulting effect on our children seeing FIL decline daily is not one we want to put them through. It also seems like they would be better suited with that money in the bank from the sale at market value if external care is required."

I did the usual thing and gave her directions for the  minute walk which is where I had just walked past and she wasn’t really getting it. She explained she needed to get to the job centre or she wouldn’t get her money and her appointment was in  minutes and mentioned she was Ukrainian and asked if I could help her. I then offered to walk her to the place as she did seem quite anxious we walked the  minutes to where she needed to go in my opposite direction and she then recognised the building when we got to it. She was really happy and gave me a massive hug. It was a really lovely thing that a stranger would be so happy someone helped her she threw her arms around me like it was a life changing event that occurred and it’s struck me all day just how as British people that would never have happened between two people in that exchange or at least I never would have anticipated that scenario.

I trained as an actor but didn’t know how to get an agent or “become an actor” so ended up temping until I fell into comedy and it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me. I have diagnosed OCD and credit stand-up with giving my brain a joyful and kind, alternative place to go. 

I have written and performed  live shows, one of which is an Amazon Special called Immaculate (thanks for watching if you have) and I’m working on my fourth show, I love the start of the creative process even though it’s terrifying. I’m also working on my first scripted project and my Live at the Apollo debut performance comes out on January th which is exciting. 

I co-host a weekly podcast called Trusty Hogs with comedian Helen Bauer where we attempt to be functioning adults and also to help our listeners with their problems. I also co-host a podcast with comedian Larry Dean (who did the first AMA in this series) called Shared Baggage, which is all about romantic relationships. I’m @catherinebohart on insta/twitter/tiktok

CasualUK,Is it not socially acceptable to piss the sea??,"Was talking to some mates about looking forward to the summer, we started making plans about getting the train to the beach, have some cans and take a dip in the sea.

""all well and good like but what if i need a piss?"" one lass asked and i replied ""that's why you take a dip in the sea"" and everyone recoiled like ""remind me not to swim next to you"" and even ""that's bad for the ocean""

What? I've always done this and thought it was okay?? The lads said they just go into the woods and piss on a tree but it's easier for me to just submerge my bottom half in what's likely % basking shark piss anyway. I'm not talking clear calm waters of Cornwall with tons of people swimming like, this is just off the river mersey and you're more likely to be swimming next to someones dog than another person.

Have I just been a scruff by doing this? Surely it's better than pissing on a squirrels house???"

CasualUK,Has anyone successfully lied to an estate agent about deposit size to secure a property to buy?,"Sorry for double posting as I've also asked in HousingUK, but I need to reply to the estate agent in the next - hours and this sub is a lot more active and talks about this kind of thing...

Me and my partner are first time buyers, and we put an offer of £k on a £k property a few months ago. We have our mortgage in principal from a rd party advisor we've known for years, and it's for something like £k, and our deposit is around £k. When we put our offer in, the estate agent rang and asked my partner what our financial situation was, and the size of our deposit or LTV ratio, and my partner gave them the honest numbers. We got a call the next day to say the property had gone to someone else, and when we tried to get more information out of them, the estate agent essentially said it was down to size of deposit and if we'd had a bigger deposit it'd have likely gone our way.

This annoyed the fuck out of me as I don't really get why they're asking these kinds of questions when we already have a mortgage in principle agreed elsewhere, unless they're just trying to sell us a mortgage or something.

The property has now come back on the market, so we've put an offer in again, and they've come back to us once again saying it's going to best and final could we please detail our financial arrangements like last time.

My partner wants to be honest because that's all she ever is, but I don't see the issue with just lying and saying 'due to some recent inheritance our deposit funds available is now £k, although we may not use all of that as we'll likely save some to fix up the property', and if we get the property, we'll just use the £k as planned and if they ever found out or asked, it's none of their business how much money we've kept back in savings.

Can I get on to any shit for outright lying? Will they ever even find out if my mortgage is going through a rd party? Seems like something we should just blag, as it seemingly lost us the property last time, and I don't see how it affects anything or why they're even asking. I'm in England if it matters."

I work in IT for a banking group and recently it’s been a bit crap and an opportunity for another group come up. I was hesitant but applied and they offered me the role. After discussions they improved the benefits package and would see me
getting a k uplift. I verbally accepted and process has now started to join

I let my current employer know, they listened and wanted me to stay as there’s some big IT projects this year. They revised my role to a more senior role and with that improved the offer from the other banking group by k. Added to this by not leaving I would receive a possible k bonus in April.

I am torn by what this means and what to do. I was clearly unhappy enough to pursue conversations elsewhere but at same time I wasn’t being pushed out.

I also don’t like to let anyone down and I did agree to join the other group.

My head is puzzled by it and I’m not sure as to what to do. Im hoping you lovely lot can shed new perspective or downright opinions which will help my thinking. I’ve asked my husband and family but would appreciate other input.

Both offices are in the same town with similar work practice of in office/remote working.

Thanks all


Edit: for clarity, the offer from new place is k more than my current salary, my current employer has countered that with k improvement on the new place. So it would be k more than I’m currently on"

If I'm honest, I felt a bit hard done-by (and the £ fine stung) but there was no arguing it and I'm pleased I got offered the course and did it rather than got the  points on my licence because it was cool and I learned stuff and it was run by a really nice lady who made it interesting.  I feel like something useful came out of it and I learned stuff and got reminded of, among other things,...

. In ideal conditions, car doing mph that has to do an emergency stop will still be doing mph at the point where it would have stopped had it been doing mph.  
. If there are street lights, unless otherwise specified by speed limit signs, you're in a mph limit.
. If lanes  and  on a motorway have a mph sign over them on the gantry and lane  doesn't, lane  is still a mph limit and the bulbs have just gone on the sign so still only do .
. If someone's tailgating you, slow down to put more room between you and the car in front so you can stop slower if they stop.
. A dual carriageway is defined by having a barrier separating carriages and not by the number of lanes on each side.  If you can roll a giant ball across the entire road without it being stopped on the central reservation (because there's not barrier, not because it bounced or something) , it's not a dual carriageway.

Just thought I'd pass it on."

It's a terrifying thought... We've been told by consultants that I should succeed, but if I don't, all that money wasted to get this far.

Even worse, if I am successful, beginning to make plans to relocate to a different hemisphere, a different country whose culture is similar enough to what I grew up with but still vastly different scares the poop out of me.

CasualUK,Today I accidentally farted and heard it through my noise canceling headphones... On a train.,"Okay I need to let this out (pardon the pun) as I feel the need yo explain my actions on what happened today, just in case someone witnessed what went on today with myself and my untrustworthy bowels. 

I had a stomach ache for the majority of the day, especially towards the time of me getting onto this train. I didn't have time to go to the toilet as I was already running late for this packed train that lies ahead of me. The train was the usual packness as you would expect for a pm train, which usually wouldn't bother me but it did today. Purely because I was praying it would be semi empty so I could unleash hell in the toilet on the train, but no.

I sat down wedged in between two other commuters and put on some relaxing music to help curve this God awful ache I had in my stomach. But the rumbling began. 

Now I'm not one of those people that happily shart on a train full of people, I would rather be in pain than let some stranger have a whiff of my excrement. So I held it in whilst shaking my leg up and down, honestly it must've looked like I was on something as it was freezing and I was sweating bullets. 

I'm  minutes away from my stop, finally, I can get out of here and quickly get to the nearest toilet and cobblestone the unwilling toilet. I get up a few minutes before the train announces the station as I want to be the first at the door to rush of. 

And that's when it all fell apart... 

And I leaned to get up I must've pressed on my stomach a bit too eagerly and ripped the absolute loudest and most vibrational fart I've ever done in my life. Which went on for a good few seconds. 

This so called stomach ache was trapped fucking wind all along. 

I concluded my devilish wind whilst listening to the London symphony orchestra are in my ears giving a bloody fantastic show. I even without thinking said ""oh fuck"" quietly to myself as I realsed I had the noise cancelling option on my earphones. I hear it all. I couldn't look up because I felt people burning lasers into my skull. 

I continued to wait by the door and within a few minutes I was off the train with no stomach ache in sight."

It was the late s and everybody who worked there smoked like chimneys so at break time, everyone would go to the “smoking room” which was a disused garage with chairs and a few tables in it. I spent every break time there because almost everyone who worked there smoked and so the official “break room” was always empty, and I didn’t want to spend all my breaks on my own. 

The garage was in bad shape and there was a roof with corrugated cement tiles which flaked white stuff down onto the seats which we would often brush off before we sat down. People said it was asbestos and laughed it off - after all these were all die hard smokers so they knew they were taking their chances anyway. I was only  when I started there so I guess I looked up to them and thought that if they weren’t worried about it then I shouldn’t be either. 

I think of it every now and then and wonder if there’s any point worrying. I wonder if there’s any point in knowing whether it was asbestos or not? I’ve googled corrugated cement garage tiles containing asbestos and they look just like the ones in the roof of the smoking shed. I’ve read that it’s a risk if you’re exposed young and repeatedly, and I worked there every week from the age of  to . 

What, if anything, should I do? If I’m going to get mesothelioma presumably there’s nothing I can do about it right? If you were in my position what would you do?

CasualUK,(first time traveller) How does one go to Europe?,"I know this probably sounds like a ridiculous question.  I did ask in AskUK but it git removed, so I'm hoping I can ask here. 

I'm in my s. Never been out of the country, and am in the process of obtaining my first passport (yay!). I would like to go to Europe (specifically the Netherlands for my first time). 

The only problem is that I don't really know how it all works since the whole... leaving the continent and global shutdown thing. Any information I find seems to be completely out of date. 

Do I need a visa now? Are there any forms that need filling in? Vax passports? Can I just buy a plane ticket and go? 

Sorry if this all seems pretty silly and obvious, but i guess there's a first time for everything. 

TIA.

Edit; thank you so much for all of your help!"

As of this morning, they are still sat in the new locker awaiting pickup. It's been a week now and still nothing.

I've never had this with InPost before, they're usually pretty reliable, if fairly slow compared to other couriers. Is anyone else having issues with them at the moment? I'm unsure where to go from here as obviously a week with no progress is making my eBay buyers pretty irritated."

The Wedding Present: My favourite dress

Except in one set phrase : half past where I (I think at least) sometimes say both words with this ' man ' vowel i.e haff passt . ( i do say past with the shorter vowel even outside of this context tho) 

Id be interested to know if you pronounce half with a long or short vowel , if your accent perhaps exhibits a similar to mine , whereby half is pronounced shortly in the set phrase ' half past' and which county in England ( or any other constituent country in the Uk ) you are from. My mum ( Worcestershire ) does this too , probably more often than me ( Warwickshire) ."

The man running the place is an extremely enthusiastic and bubbly caucasian American man who seems to know % of customers by their first name. He doesn’t stick to menu prices, instead rounding to a convenient number to avoid too much change (£. becomes £ etc). He will give away free prawn crackers by asking ‘sack of crack from the back?’ and has been known to give away cans of drink if he happens to have extra. He also doesn’t use order numbers or take names. For deliveries he takes an address only and for collection orders he will ask the cost of your order. If more than one person has the same value then he lists the contents almost too quickly to understand but it seems to work.

Tonight someone I assumed was a regular came in and placed an order then shuffled out of the door. Ten minutes later he came back with a carrier bag that contained two pheasants. The enthusiastic proprietor then tried to offload these unprepared birds onto one of his delivery drivers who was eventually convinced to take them.

Most of this happened with - people in a space no bigger than m x m so all in all it was a bit of sensory overload."

CasualUK,Appealed a parking fine and won!,"Anyone else have little victories today?

Before Xmas I went to A&amp;E for my little girl and was in there a surprisingly short  minutes. And I ￼wholeheartedly forgot to pay the £ charge, for up to one hour of parking! 

They sent their usual £ (half price if early) fine warning thingy in the post a couple of weeks ago (Happy New Year, me)! Now Xmas caught up with me financially so really wasn’t financially stable to even pay the reduced fee! So I appealed for the first time ever and it worked! 

This A&amp;E is recently refurbished and I pointed out that at this new A&amp;E there are no parking payment machines (there are by the hospital main entrance, where I would’ve had to go) and i￼t isn’t very visibly signed where they are in this new A&amp;E and also that I was worried about my daughter (with Strep A etc about at the time). My daughter a couple of days later was admitted (for  days) so I also mentioned that when she was admitted I paid £ for H parking,  days in a row when I could have paid nothing for being a parent of a patient! 
It seems that £ they lost out on wasn’t worth it 

Have I been lucky to win this appeal or is it fairly common for the small fee I owed initially?"

I love football and UFC so BT Sport would be the best option for me and it seems like a bargain, too good to be true tbh. So I checked online and it says that you can only watch BT on your phone? It will auto-lock if the app doesn't detect an EE sim card. Is this the case? I would ideally like to watch it on laptop or my PS."

CasualUK,How do i just not loose friends?,"Recently i've had a friend tell me that they don't value the friendship as much as i do. Now generally that's okay, and i can accept that as i've always been someone who's emotionally strong and just trust people every easily. but what hurt me was how much it seemed that i bothered them, i know sometimes i'm annoying but i really just assumed i was being a good friend.

Around christmas time they mentioned that they would spend christmas day alone, and that made me so so sad, so i thought if they're gonna be alone i'll get them some presents (not expensive just primark pjs and a cake). After i gave it to them they said it made them uncomfortable i suppose that should've been a sign to me that clearly i miss understood the dynamic as i genuinely thought i was doing something nice. I can handle that they want to talk to me less because they're busy and all but even now the way they talk and the things we talk about isn't the same. A couple of other things happened that now looking back should've been clear signs that i wasn't valued; but now we're talking so so i suppose and sadly the tone of the conversation just seems like it's being forced. And i can't lie. it just makes me cry. i'm just sensitive but things like this just really hurt me because i start overthinking and thinking what's wrong with me. what have i done? in this case i think i was just being too much like my authentic self. i really just like making people happy. 

i suppose i should try and go and make new friends, any advice on how to make friends or idk how to be a better person. would be appreciated :)"

I did have one bloke out who clearly didn’t want to do the job and instead of saying as much, was rude and misogynistic and kept on about all his ailments that would prevent him from doing the job and how he’s nearly  and should be retiring. Fine if you don’t want work, Close your business on Google then!

I do have someone bookedin for this week but they’ve said I’m to move the toilet out myself to expose the pipes, which neither me nor my boyfriend want to do and to be honest if I could do that is have a go at fixing it myself! They also said they can’t guarantee they won’t break the toilet getting it out! They’ve quoted  an hour though! Now I know prices of things are going up a lot these days, but am I wrong in thinking this is a bit extortionate? I’m in NW England. I know they’ve probably priced it so I go elsewhere but I can’t find anyone willing to get this done.

I live in a rented house as a lodger and my bed is up against one of the exterior walls, which gets very cold when it is cold outside. The wall gains condensation and becomes damp, and it is getting mouldy often. I clean it twice a week with mould remover but it keeps coming back. I’ve tried moving my bed further from the wall and adequately ventilating but it’s a persistent issue. Because it’s so cold outside and warm in my room, the windows fill up with condensation and so do the exterior walls. It’s causing my pillows to get damp at night. 

Any advice for tackling this problem? I’m going to try and move my bed to another part of the room, not touching exterior walls. But would like to know if there is anything else I can try. I crack a window in the morning for a good half hour but it isn’t helping. Thanks!"

Does anyone know anywhere which is comparable to something like this? Basically I’m looking for something that little extra that’s more than just a small pool, steam room, and sauna. 

Thanks for any and all recommendations!

So I downloaded all my transactions from , sat and categorised them all (groceries, car maintenance, holiday spend, ect) thinking this would be a good starting point to make some changes. 

I spent £. on take out food and coffee in . Yes, £.. That includes all coffee shops and deliveroo type things. 

I’m disgusted with myself, ashamed and appalled. 

I don’t earn a lot, below the national average but have a relatively low cost of living. 

That money could have been better spent, or saved. Or literally given to someone who needed it, any of those would have been better than take out coffee and food!

I live in Essex, and I'm planning on visiting Plymouth for the first time to visit my best friend of  + years. I've been considering ways to get there, and my first thought was driving, although even after a couple of years of driving, I still need to be more confident. 

So, my next thought was the train. I've done this once before to Cornwall. However, it was very uncomfortable because the chair dividers dug in, and I had a lot of hip pain when I finally arrived. I'm a larger person, approx. st but I'm ft , so I don't necessarily look as big as you would expect,

If someone gave me a glass of milk and a bowl of sugar with a spoon to sweeten it, I'd think they are fucking bonkers. But this post frosties milk was allowed?

Fast forward a month, I was having a mexican dish night and have some pineapple salsa. My partner, making up a taco put cheese on it and I was repulsed by this, then thought about the fact that I'll happily have pineapple on a pizza (this is not a pineapple post.)

Then lastly, whilst having a well known sandwich brand sandwich, I had some pickle covered in sweet BBQ sauce drop out. I picked it up off the paper wrapper, popped it in my mouth and chewed it happily, savouring the taste. But if someone popped a bottle of sweet BBQ sauce and a dish of sliced pickles and said ""here you go, eat these just dip em in the sauce first"" i would think ""wtf is wrong with you.""

What examples of ""it's ok food"" do you have that if you were to break it down to the items like this, it suddenly seems partially psychotic?"

I do know sometimes I have no filter with employees and sometimes I can be a bit harsh..couple of times my senior management has bought it too my attention when an employee has not made a complaint but said they was upset with my methods,on these occasions I did speak - with them and we resolved any issues.

How do I stop being abrasive if my boss allows me to be that way because I'm getting the results he wants?I don't mean to be that way.."

CasualUK,British middle class crime - someone’s nicked our garden waste bin!,"So was doing a bit of tidying in the garage yesterday morning and had the black bin and recycling bin out. Went to put them back and thought “hang on, where’s the garden bin?”. It was out on the driveway on Friday and sure enough there’s a dry patch where bin had been. 

I recently had a new shiny one (as we didn’t have one before) so possible that someone’s taking a liking to it and snatched it in the night. Admittedly, it’s a bin and worse crimes have been committed but I’ll still have to lose about £ replacing it. Unfortunately I didn’t put our house number on it so no marks to identify it by (other than a lot of ash in the bottom) and maybe why someone thought it was an easy pinch.

So thoughts are:
The neighbours ring doorbell probably won’t catch the thief but might pinpoint what hour it was taken - if it can see our driveway. 
I could wait  weeks, see who has a new garden bin out and then check with the council to see if they’ve ordered a new one (new ones are quite distinctive with a black base and brown lid). Could lead to a confrontation with only evidence from the council that they have my bin…
Police I assume, will have no interest at all in this so maybe just worth reporting it to be a statistic and leave it at that

The game is obviously a foot and any other thoughts or observations on how to solve this great Surrey crime would be appreciated."

the author of the article wrote ""he carried his entire life in a big bag"" as if it was a bad thing...

But he isn't accumulating unnecessary things, is extremely versatile in his luggage, and I dare say pollutes very little, in terms of his carbon footprint.

He doesn't need to spend a small fortune hiring removals teams whenever he moves.

He doesn't burn electricity on wasteful things like keeping televisions on standby, and keeping the fridge running whmith just a pint of milk and a few eggs in.

is it fair to dictate a persons' success by the items they own? or have we all fallen for the consumerism agenda pushed by the global businessmen?

I’m interested to hear of your experiences using meal subscription services. I’ve signed up to Hello fresh this week, to be honest because I’m a sucker for a ‘rope you in’ discount code (% off for the record) but also because I am a single folk, can’t be arsed going to the supermarket most of the time, and I actual think it’s going to save me money. I spend huge chunks of the yeah working away from home too, during which I can pause the deliveries whilst I’m gone and allegedly turn up home knackered disheveled and road weary many weeks later to a nice box of tasty eats. All sounds good. 

Anyone who uses these types of things, give me your experiences good or bad before I run out of cancellation period? 

Thanks!"
CasualUK,"I feel like I invented an actual real life DIY tip today, and need to tell someone!","Last year I noticed our guttering leaking, so bought a tube of gutter sealant mastic. 

Up the ladder I went, only to find this thing is the stickiest nastiest stuff ever. By the end of one attempt this mastic goo was all over my ladder, gloves, jacket, everywhere except the gutter!

Today I thought I’d have another go, and immediately found the same issue. I was using a flat scraper to try to mould it into the corners, but it sticks to the scraper and when I pull the scraper away it just pulls the whole thing out. 

Then I had a thought…what if I used something I could leave in the gutter, so smooth the goo and leave it in rather than risk pulling it away and taking to goo with it. 

Then I spotted the chunk of ice that was from the bucket I was using to put the gutter rubbish in. 

So like a perfect murder weapon I used this “ice knife” to smooth the goo, and oh my god, it was amazing, it didn’t stick to the ice knife at all, was completely able to smooth the goo into the corners and the gaps, and got no goo on me or my jacket! 

If anyone ever finds themselves with sticky mastic goo, use an ice knife. 

I’m pretty proud of myself!"

This weekend I stumbled upon an Indoor Bowls match. My  year old was rather fascinated by the special balls and laughed out loud when they collided, so we watched it for a while and it's amazing how accurate the players are. 

My question is: what are the rules for the sport?

And maybe more important: how do you score? Is it the closest ball to the Jack (yes that ball I know by now, haha) or is a touch with the Jack a point? Because they spray something on the ball that touched it. 

Wikipedia does not have a lot of info, I hope I'm in the right place with my questions.

CasualUK,A quick guide for those infiltrating.,"In the last week or so on this sub I've seen someone refer to Lynx body spray as a cheap Axe knock off, today there is a thread about sneaking food in to the cinema and people have mentioned sneaking in chic fil-A and stopping at Walgreens or CVS pharmacy to stock up on the way. It's great that this sub brings so many together but as it is a UK sub I thought it might help our foreign cousins understand what we call things here and what we have and don't have.

Lynx body spray - Axe body spray

Walkers crisps- Lays chips

Fast food restaurants we do have in abundance: McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Subway. There are a few other's but only found in large metropolitan places normally such as Wendy's, Dunkin Donuts and Jollibees and even the odd Tim Horton's coffee. 

We also have Starbucks everywhere.

We have Reece's peanutbutter cups readily available in most good retailers, but you'll struggle to find a pack of Reese's pieces outside of specialist sweet shops or larger supermarkets (don't ask me why, I love the pieces).

We don't call fizzy drinks soda, they are fizzy drinks or pop, and if you're in Scotland and get asked for a can of ginge, this means Irn Bru, a Scottish popular fizzy drink, on the topic of Scotland, all drinks that aren't alcoholic are referred to as juice, not just fruit juice, coca cola or fanta is juice in Scotland.

Other UK folks, what else is specific to the UK that you can think of?

Being at that age I feel like it would be a huge loss if we lose a human like him. Most of the time we understand someone's value when they passed away, but I would like to express my deep appreciation and respect to him for dedicating his whole life for researching, documenting and teaching about our planet.   

Thank you, David"

Anyway, I have my Dad's old  BBC Marconiphone Stereogram (pics come up if you Google it, I couldn't link any here) and it is starting to fade a little bit and needs restoration. It means a lot to me so I'd like it to go somewhere that I can trust! 

I couldn't get it on The Repair Shop so I was hoping the people of Reddit would be able to recommend anyone in the south (ideally around London, but I'll make it travel if I have to) who can do antique audio equipment repairs. It probably isn't antique to some of you, but it's too old for the local phone repair bloke!

Thanks in advance!"

CasualUK,Is our childminder taking the pss?,"I need the help of the parents of r/CasualUK. We have an -month old in childcare  days a week. He goes to a local registered childminder who employs two assistants. We're really happy with the care he receives, she follows an Ofsted curriculum, makes nutritious food, the kids love her etc. etc.

She has just sent us her holiday dates for the year and is planning on taking  days holiday this calendar year and will be closed on those days. Some of them outside of school holidays. We have to pay for half a day when she is closed due to holidays (we don't pay anything if she closes due to sickness). In our contract there's no cap on how many holiday days she can take. Based on this, we'll be paying almost £ per year for childcare we don't receive. Both my other half and I have  days holiday.

AITA thinking  days is excessive? Especially given that when she's off outside of school holidays we have to take time off for our older child in the school holidays and then for when the childminder is closed.

If this is totally standard then I'll swallow it, but at the moment I'm thinking of writing a carefully worded email querying it.

&amp;xB;

EDIT: for those mentioning bank holidays, all numbers quoted are in addition to bank holidays.

EDIT: To be clear, here are the terms in the contract:

&amp;xB;



Also, she is closed on Bank Holidays and doesn't charge us for them. 

It seems that there are many ways to arrange contracts like this, i.e paying for full days even when the child is on holiday, paying for bank holidays etc. I think the biggest issue here is probably the sheer amount of days she is closed."

CasualUK,Stuck without broadband in central London - has anyone else faced this issue or have any solutions?,"Hello everyone, I hope someone can assist me with an issue I am currently facing. In , we purchased a flat in London, specifically in the Victoria/Pimlico area. When we first moved in, we encountered difficulties in setting up broadband. In order to have access to the internet for work, we didn't have a lot of time to dig around and had to quickly sign a -year contract with Vodafone for g service, which ends in February.

During our time in the flat, we realized that the g coverage within the house is not sufficient. We had hoped to switch to a proper broadband service once our contract with Vodafone ended. However, we have been unable to find a provider that can offer broadband service in our flat. We recently contacted Sky and they informed us that there was never a broadband setup in the flat, and that the line appears to be inactive, therefore they are unable to offer us service. We also tried to contact Openreach, but they stated that for activations, we have to go through a service provider and then they will escalate the request with Openreach, but that has not been possible.

I am at a loss as to what my options are. It is baffling to me that I cannot get decent broadband service in a central London location (Zone ). Has anyone had a similar experience or have any suggestions for a solution?"

But they believe we violated their T&amp;Cs (we were deemed high risk - we run social events that relate to the adult industry, but are no less respectable that any evening at an average nightclub) so need somewhere else. But the more I look around the harder it is to find anywhere viable for a professional solution, so thought I'd generally ask here if anyone can make any suggestions?

I've been trying to use Paypal, and thought it was all sorted, but as soon as I did a real test payment for a quid, it was immediately put on hold for  days and well, we'd be stupid to let other people pay real money that way until we trust it's working properly, right? I've a feeling any review might well go against us here too, so maybe I've just wasted my time making it work.

I think I can use [ko-fi.com]( to ask for ""donations"" into a regular paypal account, but it's all a bit icky and unprofessional looking.

I wonder if going back to stripe and just signing up as something totally unrelated would be the easiest route?

Given we are potentially going to be deemed ""higher risk"" by others, there just really seems to be few reliable options for very low levels of sales, especially when I'm writing the low level web code for it all myself, and want control over it."

I attended the one in  Norwich and the first  minutes was spent auctioning off legs to play a  pro player, and then selling sports memorabilia (this was darts to  begin with, but then went into snooker and boxing as well).....

We then finally saw around an hour and a halfs worth of play, which was good, but then.......

Another hour spent  auctioning off sports tat, including football and tennis this time round....

We then finally saw the last  mins of darts play, but this felt very rushed as they had a raffle to do as well.....

People  were drunk and spending insane amounts of money on these items, which  are only worth around half what they were paying.  Also all the proceeds  for this went into the promoters pockets, and none of it was for  charity!"

CasualUK,Tooth pain update,"Hey, [quick update to the thread I made the other day.](

So the last week hasn't been fun, got to the point where I felt half the delicate parts of my skull were going to shatter under pressure. Thankfully yesterday and today were leagues less painful than Wed-Fri.

Had my first trip to the dentist in a long time and everyone was patient and reassuring. After a bit of waiting and an old lady who seemed rather insistent on sitting next to me (even though I'd take what I can get, I'm not in the best position to pull x), and I got called into the chamber of doom.

After a promise I could keep any removed teeth, a quick look, and some x-rays (there was this cool film on a stick I had to bite in place which was different), I was told that it was most likely not the wisdom tooth peeking out at an angle causing my agony - but the molar beside it with a hole in it. Nerve damage and all that, and my immune system could've kicked off the pain with the random bug I was dealing with the other week.

We had a chat about options and the choice was either a root canal or removal, but with the scope of the former and no guarantee it'd be perfect, I opted for the latter. Unfortunately I haven't had it removed due to complications so I'll be referred to a nearby specialist. I did have a protective gauze applied that should help in the meantime.

Hopefully the specialist will let me keep the tooth when it gets removed. The area where I felt pain in my skull currently feels tense, but it's much better than everything else.

I'd like to give you all a big thank you for your help &amp; advice the other day, and please if you can, get your teeth checked. I wouldn't want anyone else having to put up with the pain I've had to deal with.

edit: No i unfortunately didn't get a sticker. But the chair was extremely comfortable, I could gladly replace my bed and every chair I own with one of those."

Really kicking myself about it, I'm so fucking stupid.

Contacted my bank, and they said they'll investigate the claim but it'll take up to  days. In the meantime, a conditional refund tomorrow. But if the woman waiting behind me just took it and walked off, as it would show on CCTV, I'm guessing that the refund would be reclaimed by the bank and I'd be out of luck? Unless they would allow the refund due to theft? Not sure how that would work. They said they'll check CCTV if needed.

[Tilly by the back door](

She is not our cat.  But she comes to our back door and window every day and consistently throughout the day.  I live in Wales - it's really cold out for the last couple months, reaching as low as -c at one point recently.  The neighbours seems to kick her out every night too, so she is outside during these temps - something I would never do with my own two cats.

Normally, I'd have no problem letting another cat in the house, feeding strays etc (our house backs onto a farm).  But my cat Luna absolutely hates this cat in particular.  My other cat Max doesn't care at all.

&amp;xB;

[Tilly by the window](

Tilly is often starving too, we notice she shakes from the cold.

We are somewhat estranged form the neighbour in question - we have reported them to police for having unconstrained fires (where they chuck in plastic, rubbish and even household electronics like vacuum cleaners).

Every time we open the back door, she bolts to a grab a bite of biscuits we have for our cats.  Is this just opportunistic, or is it that the owners don't feed her?

I'm a student at university and I was wanting to get a part time job that would balance with my studies but I would prefer it to be remote. This is because I've done lots of other jobs in person but they don't pay very well (. an hour) for the amount of work you have to do. I live in London so managing with that would be really difficult. 

I'm looking for something that could be done over the weekend and a  weekday or a few weekdays ( days a week preferably) I've found it difficult to find any remote jobs for people like me as a lot require plenty of experience and degrees or I may be looking in the wrong place. I've checked around indeed but can't really find anything suitable. I also used remotists and some other sites but they all require some high qualification like a degree, which I haven't achieved yet. I've got good Gcse grades and my diploma from college ( equivalent to  A's at A level) as well

However, if there are any other in person jobs that pay okay and are not too strenuous I'll check them out. So far I've worked in restaurants, bars, retail stores and they all paid pretty poorly for what you do and the time.

In London my rent is really high and I'm only just managing on my own, but I'd like to find a job that can pay around £ minimum a month for part time.

If anybody can help it would be very much appreciated."

I guess for the first you're meant to wake up, take the pill, have a shower, get ready for work and eat your toast on the way out the front door an hour after taking the pill

The second is obviously an hour before your lunch break. The third is an hour before dinner and the last is  hours after dinner.

But what if you don't function like that? What if you only have  meals a day, brunch at / and dinner at /? What if you don't get up until about : by which time you're hungry and don't want to wait an hour after taking a pill, so you decide to start taking them after brunch. What if you like a little snack at about  but you can't because you had brunch and you need to take the first pill. So you take the pill, wait another hour for your snack, so you're not hungry for dinner till  and you forgot to take the pill an hour before dinner anyway so now you can't eat till , then you need to take a pill at  but that's only  pills and you're meant to take  in a day!

I'm  weeks pregnant. I'm EXHAUSTED so I can't wake up earlier, it's just not going to happen. I also have ADHD which probably doesn't help! I've eaten  meals a day for over a decade it just works better for me, the snack is a new development since pregnancy because I'm constantly starving and with how tired I am there's not a snowballs chance in hell that I'm going to wake up early enough to have breakfast instead of that snack.

The first bits went fine. And then we got onto the A, and the car goes ""nope"". We end up by the side of the road, two wheels in the mud, with a horrendous stench coming from the engine. One hurried call to  later, and then we're over the barrier to wait for the police to come, with only one of us wearing a hivis. Mine wasn't easily accessible in my suitcase, unlike mum's.

Traffic officer decided quickly that it was the clutch, and towed us to the layby we'd been unable to reach before all power went. Then we started the wait for the AA. Inside the car, this time. He came, agreed that it was the clutch, and he arranged a recovery truck and tried to sort out a hire car and local repair. No dice, neither Bury St Edmunds nor Thetford has anything available for hire. Damnit.

He did decide to move the two of us to the Tesco at the previous junction, leaving the car in the layby with hazards flashing, so we're safely in the warm until the truck arrives.

Best thing is, we're not in mum's car right now. It's dad's car that's broken down, as mum's car refused to start on Sunday, when we headed out to work. So dad is going to go spare once he reads his texts later.

And I haven't phoned work to tell them we might not make it either.

Need advice, please. I’m in an end terraced property which I bought. My neighbours are renting via an agency. Their landlord lives on our street. 

Problem- when neighbours moved in mid last year, they politely approached me that their  dogs are “a bit nervous” and I should bear with them till they settled in. I appreciated this and tolerated the yapping from the dogs for about  months. It was particularly bad during summer as I worked from home but couldn’t open my windows because the dogs didn’t stop barking. 

Middle of December, I approached them to ask if they’re doing anything about the dogs and they completely went defensive and denied that their dogs bark. They accused me of leaving my windows open in the summer and even said I should be able to go back to sleep when they wake me up in the midnight. 

I reported to the landlord who was surprised they had dogs at all. Apparently, it’s a breach of their contract. I was directed to the letting agency who were full of promises. The agency later told me that neighbours denied owning the dogs and lied that they belong to their mum. Despite video evidences, they’re unable to take it further. 

I’m off sick at home this week and been unable to rest due to the dogs’ barking. Neighbour has said to me categorically that “nothing is going to change”. Reported to the council and expecting a noise diary. What more can I do? 

Surprised that agency has just rinsed their hands off. I dread returning home now and this is sad as I worked really hard to buy the property."

All of a sudden I was transported back to the ’s, I haven’t heard mention of a magnetic stud since I was a teenager, discovering them for the first time and thinking how super cool I’d look with one to go with my freshly wella mousse dyed hair in the colour ‘chilli’!! 

I got one and it was rubbish, when it did manage to stick it would flip on to its side within seconds, totally not cool but I probably still wore it for a bit! I was too young to get a real one and changed my mind when I was finally old enough hahah!

CasualUK,Moving to a house with a name instead of a number - If I change the name what happens to mail sent to 'old' name?,"Per title, I'm about to move to a house that has a name rather than a number. The name is kinda shit and I want to change it, but I'm not sure as yet what to change it to, so I'll therefore be changing my address in various places (delivery address, doctors, dentist, HMRC etc.) very shortly but it might be some time before I've settled on a name that I like. I'm aware that I can change the name with my local council fairly easily, but what I'm unsure about is what would happen to any mail sent to the old name once it's changed? For example:

If the current name/address is:
&gt; Barry the Bungalol

&gt; Some Street

&gt;Some Town

and I change it to:
&gt; Harry the House

&gt; Some Street

&gt; Some Town

...what would happen to mail sent to Barry the Bungalol? Does the Royal Mail keep a history of the name change and mail sent to me at the old name will still arrive, or would I need to update all of the organisations with the new address? Additionally, what would happen to mail sent to the old occupants if they have a redirect in place (they'll obviously have this set up for the old name, which I'll be changing). 

I can't seem to find any information on this, so I'm wondering if anyone has any experience of the situation? Cheers!"

CasualUK,"How do Corner shops manage to stock such an amazing array of products? But more importantly, why do all the ones in London not sell crumpets? Feel free to share any corner shop stories!","In London most of the local shops are Turkish (or Kurdish) run (at least in North London). They have a mind-boggling array of up to date bang on trend products; organically sourced ethical quinoa vegan bacon replacement, hoppy IPA's made from CBD oil by a gender neutral owned brewery, vapes in more flavours than a Willy Wonka gobstopper, eight different types of fresh tomatoes, but never crumpets! What's going on?

I have questions:

. How do they source and price their goods? I run a shop and really struggle to keep up to date inventory (and my stuff doesn't go off, it's a bike shop) as well as get it all priced up correctly.
. How do they manage so many lines? If you compare the selection of, say, tinned tomatoes to our local small Tesco, the local shop has about  different types, Tesco has .
. How do they stay so on trend? It's not like ol' Mehmut behind the counter is knocking back spirulina smoothies and vegan cheese on sourdough. Does the cash and carry just tell them what to buy and which breweries to get the beer from?
. Why do they never sell crumpets? I've even tried explaining the concept of a crumpet to several of my local shops, pointing out how they're really popular, showing photos, showing how every supermarket sells them, but no. And yes, I know I can plan ahead but when you've had  pints at the pub and you're wondering what you're going to have for breakfast, nothing quite hits the mark like a crumpet, so you need to buy them on a whim and fairly regularly. They sell all sorts of different breads, rolls, sourdough, rye bread etc etc.

Other observations welcome, but if anyone has had any success in explaining the concept of a crumpet to a shop and getting them to stock it, please do advise."

The dog who I helped be returned to his owner after he escaped from his house and followed me home (story in comment),"So I was out on my daily walk and this big boy ran up to me and said hello, he was extremely energetic but had no collar on. Assuming he was on a walk with his owner I put my earphones back in and walked all the way home. 

Only when I went to unlock my door and I took my earphones out did Max decide I was his owner and ran straight inside my home making himself quite at home! (after asking neighbours turns out he followed me around about  yards behind me, hence why I wasn't aware of him following me) 

After posting on the local Facebook the owners contacted me and we met halfway with their other dog, they were very happy to see Max returned to them and were very grateful. I got one goodbye kiss from Max and off he went home. It certainly made my day more interesting and for the short time I knew Max, he was a very playful and happy (not so little) guy! 

The high vis vest was my attempt of making a collar to walk him up to his owner, it worked but I don't think my Scout master intended this is how id use the knots he taught me.

I go to the letterbox and there's a slip in the door. ""On its way back to your local office"", which isn't open until tomorrow morning.

So Posties, be honest, no judgement, what's the story here?

It feels to me like perhaps the parcel has been at the delivery office the whole time and someone is quietly delivering missed delivery cards so I go get the parcel myself.

This seems like a silly conspiracy theory to me because surely it would take extra effort to write all the cards in advance, but I suppose  missed parcel cards is easier to deliver than  parcels.

Is this really the case? who is it who decides to do that strategy? The Postie on the ground? The local postmaster?

EDIT: not sure if it makes a difference, but it was a guaranteed next day delivery, signed for. Does delivering a card absolve them of missing a next day delivery for the likes of Amazon perhaps?"

Went to my local 'Fios' (Turkish/Med supermarket).  
Apparently you are supposed to sort/bag each different fruit/veg into their own plastic bags (what a damn waste). E.g,  button mushrooms need their own bag vs shiitake shrooms, so it makes pricing/weighing easier/quicker).

At checkout shes moaning and complaining to herself/coworker whilst lifting up the bags filled with Brocolli, spinash and pears (I had about / different bags of all this, with one being a mixed shroom bag).

She then offloads a sneeze into her Left hand. Procceeds to sort/price up my fruit+veg.  
I stare in horror...  
She then offloads another sneeze into her Right hand. Proceeds to sort/price up my fruit+veg.  
I stare in horror again...

Could not believe what I had just witnessed.  
Horror. Utter shock and horror.  
She's oblivious to what she's doing.

To those who love their air fryers. Do you consider yourselves to be decent cooks, who enjoy experimenting with food? Or is the air fryer simply a means to an end, shove some frozen stuff and maybe some veg or potatoes in there and don't think too hard?

I want one, but I'm worried it'll be a waste. I cook an XL roast about once a week for the family of four. I like the idea of putting it in an air fryer. I don't think XL will fit though? I do curries, stews (beef, lamb, veg), roasts (chicken, pork, lamb), various pastas, creamy chicken, occasional pies (self made), seafood, fish (not so much the crumbed kind), and things along those lines.

I hear stories of people not using their oven again after they bought an air fryer but I'm unsure if my cooking style would suit that?

Pricy though. Also unsure if one big unit would be better than two drawers."

Anyway, he finally just told me he hasn't received his payment and is struggling, the stubborn old goat he is, so I phoned the government number for him.
Turns out he wasn't even in the system, so now he may not get the payment til March.

So I wanted to warn/advise people on here, if you or your family haven't heard about the  yet, you should call that number. Details as follows:


Phone number:   

Don't let yourselves or your loved ones miss out on what they need to survive. Especially if they are as stubborn as my father.

I've had a lot of personal issues recently (breakup of a relationship I thought was forever) and there are lots of things in this job that I've never done to this level.  My manager has made comments about my work not being up to the level they need.  I'm flailing and too burnt out to be able to push myself harder.  Some days I just stare at my screen and can't work out what to do.  So I do nothing.

I'm in my s, and at a manager level.

I'm still in my probation period, and I suspect they just want me gone.  I get it.  I kind of want me gone too.  I need time off.  I can't afford it but I also can't function in any useful capacity right now.  I can't even think of an argument for them to keep me.

I have a second, part-time job waitressing.  It's minimum wage, but I like it and I'm good at it.  They've said if I get let go from my day job they'll give me as many hours as they can, and have offered to bump me up to supervisor.  It's not enough to keep me afloat, but it's enough to help me to drown a bit more slowly.

If I quit, I'll get less Job Seeker's Allowance.  But that's like  pounds per week.  I can likely make more than that in an extra day of slinging pizza.  If I resign... maybe I'll get a more favourable reference?  They won't be able to tell future jobs I was fired.  Does that even matter?

Sidenote - I am also thinking to take a bit of time off office jobs to reevaluate my career, and what I want to do next because this isn't it.  But I'm so scared I will struggle to get - something - when the time comes."

On top of all this, Slurpy gave Ditzy and Chelpy some gum an hour ago which, I shit you not, makes the whole office sound like  octopi mud wrestling while  camels have a groaning competition. The sole reprieve is when someone leaves or enters, which is when the door slams thunderously.

Surely it would make more sense to follow basically any other sector which needs a birds-eye view of the situation (insurance, search &amp; rescue, etc.) and use drones?

The only reason I can cook up in my head is that they took out a long-term lease prior to drone technology becoming a practical replacement.

CasualUK,potentially moving to UK,"hey people. I am a software engineer currently working in Stockholm, Sweden. I have an offer from UK from a company that's in Nottingham and Cambridge. I am happy with the offer and I am looking for a few opinions on the whole stuff.

&amp;xB;

Some information you would need

. I will be moving with my wife and a  year old son
. Offer is of K pounds + relocation support
. Work is fully remote so I dont need to be in middle of a city

&amp;xB;

At this point, I am just casually looking at different cities and their outskrits to figure out where can I settle. A few requirements are

. Walkable distance to a preschool for my son
. Generally a safe and a family friendly area
. A near by train / subway / bus station that can get me to the city or a ""center""
. I love being around lakes and gardens (Sweden has spoiled me) 

&amp;xB;

Questions:

. With this, what cities / towns can I look at near Cambridge? 
. My wife speaks English but not very fluent, one of the major issues we have in Sweden is the language barrier. Do you think its \relatively easier\ to find a job in a non-IT field?
. I am pretty much going to permanently settle in the UK, so how straight forward is the process to get the PR after  years?

Go to knows

. How are the employee rights? I am going to leave everything I've built in sweden to move to UK and it will be a bummer if someone just said ""we no longer need you"" in a month (ofcourse it assumes I am good at my job). But in general, are employees treated fairly?
. What do you think is the monthly expense like for a family of of  that lives moderately. We don't really go partying considering my son and usually prefer a few drinks alone at home over the weekend.

&amp;xB;

And anything else you may want to add!"

I am trying to remember a musician that I used to hear a lot on BBC  Music either just before or during lockdown.

British male artist, their artist name is not their actual name but was two words I think, one of which had the word ""man"" in it (I think!).

The song in question was quite odd, almost like two separate songs, tempo and style kept changing. Some of lyrics talked about him wanted to be Bruce Willis in Die Hard as a kid I think.

Album art was a picture of a what looked like a nuclear missile popping out from under the sea and going off in a spiral..

Yes this is a mad request, but it's driving me mad trying to remember!

Was my friend being racist or rude or just stating a personal opinion?

EDIT: The tradesperson felt it was racist and my friend asked my opinion. I didn't think it was racist at all. Maybe a little unnecessary to add the Welsh descriptor...as they were both in Wales, but he says the tradesperson is adamant that it was very racist comment...like I wont finish the job racist."

He yelled and called me a ""f--king woke Yankee c--t"" and looked like he was about to fight me. I didn't back down. And he cycled away shouting at full volume that I'm a f--king Yankee c--t. (I've been kicked out of a pub before for telling an old creep to stop staring at me and leave me alone.)

Is this a cultural difference? Can you not call people out for doing dicky or mildly menacing things? Why can't I call people out for texting while cycling?"

So AliExpress, to me it looks dodgy, my partner really wants a fake Rickenbacker guitar for his birthday, (the real ones are  grand!) I'm happy to get him one but there is just something about that website that is making me really reluctant to order!

There are so many on there and I need to decide quickly because they come from China and I don't want to miss my partners birthday! I would just like to reiterate we know they are fakes/replicas.

The only thing I can find about ordering from there is just make sure you check seller reviews but I still feel uneasy, as they're all ranging around £ so would be a lot of money for nothing to arrive or for something shit to arrive!

There are YouTube reviews of these fake rickenbackers where people are quite impressed and happy with them but I'm just feeling so reluctant, I was going to get his family to put towards it as well and I don't want to look like a twat if it's naff or doesn't show up at all. I've told my partner my concerns but he still seems keen.

Input welcome!

Edit to add, thanks for all your comments, there are too many to respond to but I've read them all so far, thank you!

Also a few people have commented saying can't you just get X-Y-Z guitar, the reason my partner wants a fake Rickenbacker specifically is because he is a massive Beatles/John Lennon fan, he already owns  normal guitars all from me"

CasualUK,How do you feel about automatic vehicles?,"I was lucky enough to never have to buy a car until last year, always having a job where a company car/van was included from the time I left uni. During my time with my last company, I largely drove manuals. Every now and again, usually when my manual car/van was in for a service, I'd get an automatic to drive and I bloody loved it. 

I left my old company and joined my new one in September, no company car included. When choosing my own car, I was determined to get an automatic. It's such a smoother drive, particularly in traffic. I can drive from Birmingham to London only having to touch the gear stick twice - bliss. It also feels safer - I can concentrate more on the driving environment than changing in and out of gear, particularly at junctions. When in traffic on a hill, there's no risk of rolling back into the car behind me, I can cruise in traffic without changing from neutral to first to second to first to neutral. 

Automatics don't seem to be that popular on the whole in this country though. In the US, it seems to be much more popular, with a lot of people utterly unable to ""drive stick"".

How do you feel about automatics? Do you prefer manuals and why? Why aren't all vehicles automatic?"

CasualUK,Saddest moment of my life,"Saddest thing I have ever seen and experienced ever happened to me.

Was walking next to the Shoreditch High Street station. Looking at my phone for directions. Hear someone make a shocking noise. I look up and trying to figure out what's going on. I see  guys on a moped going my way. And then ... I spot the guy at the back adjusting a bicycle...in his hand. A Brompton what it looked like. He had a Brompton in his hand.

It took me a bit too long to put one thing and next together. But when I did it was too late.

When they went past me I realise they just stole it from the lady who was outside the station. I assume she was either folding it to take on in the station, or just came from the station and was unfolding it.

I'm not as sad that her bike was stolen.

I'm sad because if I paid more attention, and saw it happen instead of looking on my phone it was absolutely the easiest situation for me to stop them. The road narrows in that part, they went very close to me, i could have pulled the bike very very easily and either they would have let go or would go down on the ground.

I'm sad, if I saw it as it happened I would have known it was theft and would have taken the bike back. Honestly it was very easy in that situation. But I was confused and was trying to figure out was going on.

I could blame her for not shouting ""thief"" or ""stop them"". It would have made it easier. But she was more shocked than I was.

And it was heart breaking seeing her start sobbing afterwards.

I could have easily stopped them."

My daughter’s mother (my ex) squeezed the shampoo directly onto her head, who looked like she got a bit of a chill and my ex said something like ‘oh was that cold!’ So I said ‘why don’t you put the shampoo on your hand first then lather it in so it’s a bit warmer (which is what I do)?’ And she just shrugged me off in a ‘yeah, whatever, noted’ fashion, but has not changed tack. 

But it got me thinking, have I been doing it wrong this whole time? Am I the weird one? I use the same technique whether I’m washing my own or my daughter’s hair - shampoo onto hand, lather, apply to head. Is this wrong? Are there people out there who squeeze a dollop of shampoo directly onto their head in the shower? Or is it onto hands if you’re washing your own hair but straight onto head if you’re washing someone else’s???

I known for some visiting you sexual health clinic might be daunting, but in the nicest way possible, no one there cares who you are. They see hundreds of gentiles weekly, of various shapes and sizes, there is nothing embarrassing about it. Whil you are there, get your hep b vaccine and if you are a man who has sex with men and are under , get your HPV vaccine too.

People A gives Person B a bag of nice clothing to drop at the charity shop. The bag includes Laura Ashley and other such brands.

Person B sells the clothing on Vinted and keeps the money.

Is person B wrong for selling the clothes that person A no longer wanted?

I am neither of these people, just know both of them. Person B told me what they'd done. Person A has no idea that the clothes were sold rather than donated, and selling them let person B buy some food to keep in the freezer."

Until I get a car I have to rely on lifts or taxis to work because there is no buses or trains. I’m just so angry! 

There are no street lights on my road and the car didn’t have headlights on that they were driving so I’ve got no reg just a description of the car.

Next blue bin collection day comes. They take our bin again and leave their's. And I notice that they have somebody else's black bin too. I guess we now permanently have number 's bin at in number 's front garden.

FYI, they don't have anything nasty lurking at the bottom of their blue bin, no nasty smell, nothing. It's a perfectly normal blue bin for cardboard and paper. It's not any bigger or smaller than our bin, it's exactly the same.

But now I'm thinking maybe we actually did have a superior bin and never realised it? What are we missing out on? What curse has their bin put on our house now? What if all our neighbours now think I'm a bin thief because I've got 's bin in my front garden?"

CasualUK,Does anybody else feel like they don't have any friends left in their s?,"I  was decently popular in school, had a good group of friends and a  pretty wide social network. When we left all my friends went to  different parts of the country to study, me included. At the start we  stayed in touch regularly, saw each other every summer and through term.  But gradually people started to drop out of contact.

I  built up a pretty decent group of friends at uni too mainly through  sports clubs, met my wife there. And then when when we all graduated  everybody again moved to different parts of the country for work. While  there was a handful of us that remained, over the years people have also  gradually moved away or dropped out of contact.

We  eventually bought a house and moved out to a commuter town, but we  don't know anybody here. We've looked out for sociable things to do in  the area but it's a place full of families and all the communal events  are catered around kids or retirees. Meeting people is hard.

I  always thought of myself as a pretty social person, but now me and my  wife just spend most of our Friday and Saturday evenings staying in and  doing things together.

I sometimes  see posts on facebook (the rare times I go on there) of people from my  hometown that didn't leave. They seem to hang out in groups of around  . I recognise almost all of them. They're always celebrating the major  events in each others lives together. It feels like I'm doing something  wrong. I don't really know. It can't just be me can it?"

The beaches we have in mind aren't near residential area's e.g. Dawlish or similar so hopefully noise complaints won't be an issue.

CasualUK,"Did anyone else hear this really weird story in primary school (early s), and does anyone know where it came from?","I heard this story twice when I was a kid, the first time was at my local library's storytelling group, where the librarian would read the kids a story. The second time was in assembly at school. So if I heard it in  different places then I thought it must have been published somewhere for teachers/librarians to access. I was totally freaked out by it as a kid and the first time I heard it I cried and covered my ears. This is what I remember of the plot:

There's a guy walking in the snow and I think he either doesn't have shoes or his shoes are falling apart. Then he comes across the dead body of a man who was frozen to death. The dead man is wearing boots, so the main character tries to pull the boots off but he can't because of the ice. So he gets out a knife and cuts the dead man's feet off. He puts on the boots and then after walking some more, finds a cabin. He goes into the cabin and lights the fire and cooks some of the food he finds in the cupboards. Then there's a knock on the door so he opens it and sees a man who looks familiar but he can't work out where he's seen him before. The stranger says he's lost (I think?) so the main character says, ""Come on in, have some food and put your feet up by the fire."" The stranger then replies, ""I would if I had any feet."" The End

In hindsight I think this is a really disturbing story to read to kids. And if I heard it in two different places, surely someone else must have heard it too? Unless the teacher and the librarian were working together to traumatise children. Also I'm pretty sure in the storytelling group the librarians always read from a physical book, so it might be an actual book the exists somewhere."

CasualUK,Things to do as a married couple on the cheap,"Hi all my wife and I are in a difficult spot where the cost of living over the last year has hit me and her pretty bad, we are struggling for money and we are just about able to cover the gas and electric bills, we are just about covering ourselves there, we could likely bring the gas bills down if we had the thermostat set lower, but it saddens me to see my wife get upset because shes cold. 

We live in a s build semi detached house conversion flat with no insulation in the walls so it gets pretty cold especially on the outside walls, the electric we do better at but where we are home nearly every day and all day as she isn't able to work because of her health conditions and I care for her so I also don't work.

This leaves us without much money to do much, we haven't been to the cinema in about a year, we went to the natural history museum a couple of months ago which was nice, but we are even putting off free day trips to London for the fact even train fares are expensive. 

We live in Dagenham which is just  hour from central london so we have good transport links to the TFL so at least TFL is more affordable, but I know it's about £ off peak and £ on peak to travel into zone  so thats over £ just for a short little day trip which isn't much to loads of people but is to me and my wife when we are struggling as it is and being indoors all day every day is getting to my wife more than me, all I want is for her to be happy so would like to be able to take her on days out to make her week but just need suggestions on what we can do that won't cost us much and that maybe isn't far anyway on the train as the further it is the more money it will cost and we have yet to do anything apart from going to Asda and Aldi for food shopping trips this month. 

I know there are people sleeping rough and having to use food banks, I am thankful we aren't having to do that, I can see I made this a long post considering I made this post just for suggestions on things to do on the cheap."

I've  weather apps installed on my iPhone - the Apple one, AccuWeather, and the BBC's.  On the hour-by-hour forecast for the day, only the BBC one gave any indication that it might rain...  the other two showed % chance of rain all day.

So it seems the Apple app and AccuWeather use poor data sources for the UK, however reading the (likely US-based) reviews on the app store you'd think they're the last word in accuracy.

Pre-pandemic, you could guarantee, even on Sundays when most of my commuting takes place for Monday meetings (cheapest day for hotels), there would be a few bars open until am, and I'd normally look to turn in at ish, and even when I started commuting again at the start of , this was still the case.

In the last few months though, there seems to be less and less, and last night there was a Last Orders call at : in a bar I know that has been open until  in the past, and was in close proximity to a major concert venue that had a show on until .

I contacted them assuming they were estimates but given the wrong description to find out that i now have smart meters, apparently they could do this because it only involved a software update and no physical change to the meters. I've only lived in the house for  years so the old owner may have had smart meters.

I have no display and they say that when the app comes out i'll be able to use this (although the apps been broken for almost a year).

So today I go to the doctors for my yearly health check and they do the usual height, weight etcetera checks and we come to the questions like do you smoke? ""No""  Do you drink? ""Yes"" and now to the most annoying bit.

How many units per week? """"

The doctor will then say ""can't be  if you drink!""

I know this but it should be , I'll have a couple glass of wine if I go out somewhere nice with the misses but that's like once every few months or I'll get proper drunk if I go out with ""the boys"" but again that's maybe at most once a year.

The boxes I can chose from are -, -, -, +

Even if I add up all my units and spread them out over  weeks it comes to something like . per week. (Wine . per glass, beer . per pint roughly. . x =. (Wine per meal out)  . x =..(pints with the boys)  . x =.(yearly meals out wine total) .+.=.(all meals out plus night out with lads) .÷=.( units per week))

The doctor will then put me into the - category! No! Now I'm in the same category as if I have  glass of wine every week!!

Let's just say you and a partner or friend enjoy a bottle of wine together every Saturday and on the odd occasion you may crack open a second bottle that puts you in the - category, now that's the same as you and your partner or friend drinking  bottles every week!  What if you enjoy  bottle and a night cap every week now that's the same range as  bottles a week. Let's say you enjoy  bottles a week now your in the same category as someone that drinks , bottles a week.

This isn't a post about how good or bad anyone's drinking habits are it's about the statistics!

It's like asking how much money do you earn £ -£,  £,-£, £,+ and then saying ""wow look over % of the country earn £, pounds.

Why cant I put in less than  unit per week or . units per week? These statistics are used in monitoring the health of the uk, why do they have to be so vague?

Anyway, rant over thanks for listening. (Or Reading rather)"

CasualUK,Random BT Open Reach open engineer asking for my wife’s phone number,"So, we had a BT open reach engineer come out to the house to fix some issues with our broadband. I was at work and my wife was at home with children. Nothing unusual. 

What I did find odd was that he asked for my wife’s phone number as he was leaving so he could phone her when he’d finished at the exchange (even though we only live  meters from it). 

Initially I thought that it must have been so he could call her from a work phone but she checked the number he sent her a message from on WhatsApp and it came up as quite clearly a personal number from the profile picture. 

I’m not sure if I’m making something out of nothing but I find that very strange and quite unprofessional.

Is it normal for Open Reach engineers to do this? Has anyone else experienced a similar situation?

I didn’t turn off at Junction , Simister Island, and continued ahead on the M.

CasualUK,Need advice. Which type of professional to call for checking building structure / discover where water ingress is coming from?,"We are a bit stumped on this. Last heavy rain, we had our lounge flood with water (about an inch on sqm ). It's not from a river / stream. House is a semi detached built into the hill, with the far end of the lounge % underground. The neighbour said they had water come over the retaining wall into his garage which makes us think it's high ground water/ field/hill run off but even with that I wouldn't expect the water to end up in our house. 

We've had our plumber around who confirmed it's not a leak, suggested some of the drainage may be suboptimal but we don't know if that's the reason. So we'd like to have someone around to look at the build/structure of the house and how the 'built into the hill' was actually realized/if there are faults we need to fix to avoid this. We are not precious about removing plasterboard on the inside or anything (will have to redo it anyway).

Our first thought was a structural engineer but they came back and said they only look at the exposed structures of the house. And I assume a wall buried in the hill doesn't count as exposed? Or is that part of their remit? Any thoughts on who we could be contacting to get to the bottom of the problem/find a long term solution rather than just hope it won't rain that much again?"

&amp;xB;

But some people REALLY game this it seems. Putting on ever oven and fan heater and kettle they can manage doing this first period. That puts their judged usage through the ceiling. meaning they apparently ""save"" vast amounts of power. They pay p per wasted unit, but then get paid £ for ""saved"" unit.

&amp;xB;

So I see people making £ net profit over an afternoon just by cleverly wasting power at the right time. Is this OK? Or pretty shitty? Especially with ""good"" suppliers like Octopus, fucking them over a bit doesn't feel like it's a great move for their longevity, let alone the possible morals? But still... victimless ""crime""??? Maybe there's a line that is logical are fair on one side (charging your battery mid afternoon to not use later - no ""waste"" there) but takes the piss eventually and shouldn't be done?

But i realise something about that show, and i know some people here are gonna read this thread and just think im just stating the obvious, but......

Sometimes the contestants do well, they both go home with money, sometimes they even win golden gavels.   Other times both teams make a dreadful loss and go home with nothing.    I do not think it should necessarily be a reflection tho on how good their eyes are for spotting bargains, and knowing whats going to sell well.   I think a big part of the success rate on Bargain Hunt shows are, how flittering or frugal (or tight ass) the auction audience is.   Sometimes there are not many people there, and no one wants to break the bank at all, but other times the auctions are rather packed and there's rich big spenders there who really want an item badly, and that's when the teams will do well.

Ebay reflects this reality aswell.   Sometimes me and my friend have tried to bid on s Action Force figures bundles, but the final bid goes so high cause some rich guy with the money to spend, REALLLLLYYYY wants them.   But other times i have won bids on ebay for a cheap price because ive been the only person interested in the item, that's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes."

We have attic windows in the  bedrooms and I'm really upset to have moved in to see black mold all over the blinds. Just so worried about the affect this could have on my baby.

CasualUK,Carrying an Emergency pop up tent in your car boot.,"From my desk at work i can see the M and this morning for about  hours in light drizzle there was a family of  stranded on the hard shoulder.

When you break down on the motorway you are supposed to leave your vehicle for safety.

This got me thinking...would it be a good idea to carry an emergency pop up tent in the boot along with the usual pump, spare wheel, triangle, high vis jackets you are required in some countries?

I was thinking of the kind you get for the beach, with  sides and an open front. If you were broken down with your family, you could whip it out, pop it up in a nearby field and your family are sheltered from the wind and rain.

It could even be a brightly coloured one to aid visibility.

CasualUK,Neighbour forces me to park over my dropped kerb!!!,"In a predicament. Husband and I recently moved into new property with a drive big enough for one car and dropped kerb. 
We keep one car on drive and one outside. 
My neighbour has been there for years, he was used to the previous owner of our property (elderly lady) having no car except when her children visited. 
My predicament is that when I park outside my drive for the other car to have access into the drive I cannot park over my dropped kerb. My neighbour who has one car does not park in his drive but says that if I park without blocking my dropped kerb then his car blocks his drive by approximately /cm. 
We have kindly told him that he has one car so does it matter if he’s slightly blocking the drive but he refuses to understand as he’s so set in his ways. 
We had to knock our drive wall down because we literally could not get into our drive. 
I don’t know what to do. Because we are a new couple on the street tried to be amicable and work around it but  months in he keeps knocking on the door to say his drive is being blocked slightly by his own car and quite frankly it’s starting to really grind my gears. 
I have a hatchback my husband has a  series and he even told us to keep the hatchback out and bigger car in our drive. Even listening to him dictate that he still has an issue blocking his own drive!!!

Also, it definitely wouldn’t have been the dog as we don’t have chicken wings and she’s not a digger.
